               <p>"CURSED,
              cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that
              instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence
              which you had so
              wantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not
              yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of
              rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have
              destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants, and have
              glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"When night came, I quitted my retreat, and
              wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained
              by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish
              in fearful howlings. I was
              like a wild beast that had broken the toils;
              destroying the objects that obstructed me, and
              ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness.
              O! what a miserable night I passed! the cold stars
              shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their
              branches above me: now and then the sweet voice of a
              bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All,
              save I, were at rest or in enjoyment: I,
              like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me; and,
              finding myself unsympathised
              with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc
              and destruction around me, and then to have sat down
              and enjoyed the ruin.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"But this was a luxury of sensation that could not
              endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily
              exertion, and sank on the damp grass in the sick
              impotence of despair. There was none among the
              myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist
              me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies?
              No: from that moment I declared
              everlasting war against the species, and, more
              than all, against him who had formed me, and sent me
              forth to this insupportable misery.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and knew
              that it was impossible to return to my retreat during
              that day. Accordingly I hid myself in some thick
              underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to
              reflection on my situation.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The pleasant
              sunshine, and the pure air of day, restored me to
              some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered
              what had passed at the cottage, I could not help
              believing that I had been too hasty in my
              conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It
              was apparent that my conversation had interested the
              father in my behalf, and I was a
              fool in having exposed my person to the horror of
              his children. I ought to have familiarised the old De
              Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself
              to the rest of his family, when they should have been
              prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my
              errors to be irretrievable; and, after much
              consideration, I resolved to return to the cottage,
              seek
              the old man, and by my representations win him to my
              party.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I
              sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood
              did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.
              The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever
              acting before my eyes; the females were flying, and
              the enraged Felix tearing me from his father's feet.
              I awoke exhausted; and, finding that it was already
              night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went
              in search of food.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps
              towards the well-known path that conducted to the
              cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into my
              hovel, and remained in silent expectation of the
              accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour
              past, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the
              cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently,
              apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of
              the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot
              describe the agony of this suspence.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Presently two
              countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage,
              they entered into conversation, using violent
              gesticulations; but I did not understand what
              they said, as they spoke the
              language of the country, which differed from that
              of my
              protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached
              with another man: I was surprised, as I knew that he
              had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited
              anxiously to discover, from his discourse, the
              meaning of these unusual appearances.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"'Do you consider,' said his
              companion to him, 'that you will be obliged to
              pay three months' rent, and to lose the produce of
              your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair
              advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take
              some days to consider of your determination.'</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix, 'we can
              never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my
              father is in the greatest danger, owing to the
              dreadful circumstance that I have related. My
              wife and my sister will never recover their
              horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more.
              Take possession of your tenement, and let me fly from
              this place.'</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Felix trembled violently
              as he said this. He and his companion entered the
              cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes,
              and then departed. I never saw any of the
              family of De Lacey more.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I continued for
              the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of
              utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed,
              and had broken the only link that held me to the
              world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and
              hatred filled my bosom, and I
              did not strive to control them; but, allowing
              myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind
              towards injury and death. When I thought of my
              friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle
              eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the
              Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears
              somewhat soothed me. But again, when I reflected that
              they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a
              rage of anger; and, unable to injure any thing human,
              I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night
              advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around
              the cottage; and, after having destroyed every
              vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with
              forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence
              my operations.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from
              the woods, and quickly dispersed the clouds that had
              loitered in the heavens: the blast tore along like a
              mighty avalanche, and produced a
              kind of insanity in my spirits, that burst all
              bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry
              branch of a tree, and danced with fury around
              
              the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the
              western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly
              touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I
              waved my brand; it sunk, and, with a loud scream, I
              fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had
              collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage
              was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to
              it, and licked it with their forked and destroying
              tongues.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance
              could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the
              scene, and sought for refuge in the woods.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"And now, with the
              world before me, whither
              should I bend my steps? I resolved to fly far
              from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated
              and despised, every country must be equally horrible.
              At length the thought of you crossed my mind. I
              learned from your papers that you were my
              father, my creator; and to whom could I apply
              with more fitness than to him who had given me life?
              Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie,
              geography had not been omitted: I had learned from
              these the relative situations of the different
              countries of the earth. You had mentioned Geneva as
              the name of your native town; and towards this place
              I resolved to proceed.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I
              must travel in a south-westerly direction to reach my
              destination; but the sun was my only guide. I did not
              know the names of the towns that I was to pass
              through, nor could I ask information from a single
              human being; but I did not despair. From you only
              could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt
              no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,
              heartless creator! you had endowed me with
              perceptions and passions, and then cast me abroad an
              object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on
              you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and
              from you I determined to seek that justice
              which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being
              that wore the human form.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"My travels were
              long, and the sufferings I endured intense. It was
              late
              in autumn when I quitted the district where I had
              so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful
              of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature
              decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain
              and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen;
              the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and
              bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,
              earth! how often did I imprecate curses on the
              cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had
              fled, and all within me was turned to gall and
              bitterness. The nearer I approached to your
              habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of
              revenge enkindled
              in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were hardened;
              but I rested not. A few incidents now and then
              directed me, and I possessed a map of the country;
              but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of
              my feelings allowed me no respite: no incident
              occurred from which my rage and misery could not
              extract its food; but a circumstance that happened
              when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when
              the sun had recovered its warmth, and the earth again
              began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner
              the bitterness and horror of my feelings.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I generally rested during the day, and travelled
              only when I was secured by night from the view of
              man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay
              through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my
              journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was
              one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the
              loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the
              air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that
              had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half
              surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I
              allowed myself to be borne away by them; and,
              forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be
              happy. Soft
              tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised
              my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed
              sun which bestowed such joy upon me.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I continued to
              wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its
              boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid
              river, into which many of the trees bent their
              branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I
              paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when
              I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to
              conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I was
              scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards
              the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she
              ran from some one in sport. She continued her course
              along the precipitous sides of the river, when
              suddenly her foot slipt, and she fell into the rapid
              stream. I rushed from my hiding-place, and, with
              extreme labour from the force of the current, saved
              her, and dragged her to shore. She was senseless; and
              I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to restore
              animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the
              approach of a rustic, who was probably the person
              from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he
              darted towards me, and, tearing the girl from my
              arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.
              I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the
              man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he
              carried, at my body, and fired. I sunk to the ground,
              and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped
              into the wood.</p>

            <item>
               <p>"This was then the reward of my benevolence!
              I had saved a human being from destruction, and, as a
              recompense, I now writhed under the miserable pain of
              a wound, which shattered the flesh and bone. The
              feelings of kindness and gentleness, which I had
              entertained but a few moments before, gave place to
              hellish rage and gnashing
              of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I
              vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all
              mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me;
              my pulses paused, and I fainted.</p>

            <item>
               <p>"For some weeks I
              led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to
              cure the wound which I had received. The ball had
              entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had
              remained there or passed through; at any rate I had
              no means of extracting it. My sufferings were
              augmented also by the oppressive sense of the
              
              injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My
              daily vows rose for revenge—a
              deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone
              compensate for the outrages and anguish I had
              endured.</p>

            <item>
               <p>"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued
              my journey. The labours I endured were no longer to
              be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of
              spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted
              my
              desolate state, and made me feel more painfully
              that I was not made for the enjoyment of
              pleasure.</p>

              meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I was
              oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy
              to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening, or the
              prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous

              the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness
              of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea
              seized me, that this little creature was
              unprejudiced, and had lived too short a time to have
              imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could
              seize him, and educate him as my companion and

            For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark
            eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but
            presently my rage returned: I remembered that I was for
            ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful
            creatures could bestow; and that she whose resemblance
            I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed
            that air of divine benignity to one expressive of

              the spot where I had committed the murder, and
              seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a
              barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman
              was sleeping on some straw; she was young: not indeed
              so beautiful as her whose portrait I held; but of an
              agreeable aspect, and blooming in the loveliness of
              youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those
              whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but
              me. And then I bent over her, and whispered "Awake,
              fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give
              his life but to obtain one look of affection from
              thine eyes: my beloved, awake!"</p>

               <p>"The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran
              through me. Should she indeed awake, and see me, and
              curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she
              assuredly act, if her darkened eyes opened, and she
              beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the
              fiend within me not I, but she shall suffer: the
              murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed
              of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The
              crime had its source in her: be hers the punishment!
              Thanks to the
              lessons of Felix, and the sanguinary laws of man,
              I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her,
              and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds
              of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.</p>

               <p>"For some days I haunted the spot where these
              scenes had taken place; sometimes wishing to see you,
              sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries
              for ever. At length I wandered towards these
              mountains, and have ranged through their immense
              recesses, consumed by a burning
              passion which you alone can gratify. We may not
              part until you have promised to comply with my
              requisition. I am
              alone, and miserable; man will not associate with
              me; but one as deformed
              and horrible as myself would not deny herself to
              me. My companion must be of the same species, and
              have the same defects. This being you
              must create."</p>
