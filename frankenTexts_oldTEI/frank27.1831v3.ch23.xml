<p>IT was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for
              a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory
              light, and then retired to the inn, and contemplated
              the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains,
              obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their
              black outlines.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose
              with great violence in the west. The moon had reached
              her summit in the heavens, and was beginning to
              descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the
              flight of the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while the
              lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens,
              rendered still busier by the restless waves that were
              beginning to rise. Suddenly
              a heavy storm of rain descended.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as
              night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand
              fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful,
              while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden
              in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved
              that I would sell my life dearly, and not shrink from
              the conflict until
              my own life, or that of my adversary, was
              extinguished.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in
              timid and fearful silence; but there was something in
              my glance which communicated terror to her, and
              trembling she asked, "What is it that agitates you,
              my dear Victor? What is it you fear?"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Oh! peace, peace, my love," replied I; "this
              night, and all will be safe: but this night is
              dreadful, very dreadful."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when
              suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I
              momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I
              earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to
              join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to
              the situation of my enemy.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>She left me, and I continued some time walking up
              and down the passages of the house, and inspecting
              every corner that might afford a retreat to my
              adversary. But I discovered no trace of him, and was
              beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance
              had intervened to prevent the execution of his
              menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful
              scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth
              had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed
              into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion
              of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel
              the blood trickling in my veins, and tingling in the
              extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but
              for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed
              into the room.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I
              here to relate the destruction of the best hope, and
              the purest creature of earth? She was there, lifeless
              and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head
              hanging down, and her pale and distorted features
              half covered by her hair. Everywhere
              I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless
              arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its
              bridal bier. Could I behold this, and live? Alas!
              life is obstinate, and clings closest where it is
              most hated. For a moment only did I lose
              recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>When I recovered, I found myself surrounded by the
              people of the inn; their countenances expressed a
              breathless terror: but the horror of others appeared
              only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that
              oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room where
              lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so
              lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved
              from the posture in which I had first beheld her; and
              now, as she lay, her head upon her arm, and a
              handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might
              have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her, and
              embraced
              her with ardour; but the deadly languor and
              coldness of the limbs told me, that what I now held
              in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had
              loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the
              fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had
              ceased to issue from her lips.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>While I still hung over her in the agony of
              despair, I happened to look up. The windows of the
              room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of
              panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon
              illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown
              back; and, with a sensation of horror not to be
              described, I saw at the open window a figure the most
              hideous and abhorred. A grin
              was on the face of the monster; he seemed to
              jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards
              the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window,
              and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired: but he
              eluded me, leaped from his station, and, running with
              the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the
              lake.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the
              room. I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared,
              and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast,
              but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned
              hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have
              been a form conjured up by my fancy. After having
              landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties
              going in different directions among the woods and
              vines.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I attempted to accompany them, and proceeded a
              short distance from the house; but my head whirled
              round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I
              fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film
              covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the
              heat of fever.
              In this state I was carried back, and placed on a
              bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes
              wandered round the room, as if to seek something that
              I had lost.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>After an interval, I arose, and, as if by
              instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of
              my beloved lay. There were women weeping
              around—I hung over it, and joined my sad tears
              to theirs—all this time no distinct idea
              presented itself to my mind; but my thoughts rambled
              to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on
              
              my misfortunes, and their cause. I was bewildered
              in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of
              William, the execution of Justine, the murder of
              Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I
              knew not that my only remaining friends were safe
              from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now
              might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might
              be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder, and
              recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved to
              return to Geneva with all possible speed.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>There were no horses to be procured, and I must
              return by the lake; but the
              wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in
              torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might
              reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to
              row, and took an oar myself; for I had always
              experienced relief from mental torment in bodily
              exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and
              the excess of agitation that I endured, rendered me
              incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar; and
              leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every
              gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw the
              scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time,
              and which I had contemplated but the day before in
              the company of her who was now but a shadow and a
              recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain
              had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in
              the waters as they had done a few hours before; they
              had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so
              painful to the human mind as a great and sudden
              change. The sun might shine, or the clouds might
              lour: but nothing could appear to me as it had done
              the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every
              hope of future happiness: no
              creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so
              frightful an event is single in the history of
              man.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that
              followed this last overwhelming event. Mine has been
              a tale of horrors; I have reached their
              acme, and what I must now relate can but be
              tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends
              were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own
              strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in a few
              words, what
              remains of my hideous narration.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest
              yet lived; but the former sunk under the tidings
              that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable
              old man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had
              lost their charm and their delight—his
              Elizabeth, his
              more than daughter, whom he doated on with all
              that affection which a man feels, who in the decline
              of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly
              to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend
              that brought misery on his grey hairs, and doomed him
              to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the
              horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs
              of existence suddenly gave way: he was unable to rise
              from his bed, and in a few days he died in my
              arms.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost
              sensation, and chains and darkness were the only
              objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I
              dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and
              pleasant vales with the friends of my youth; but I
              awoke, and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy
              followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception
              of my miseries and situation, and was then released
              from my prison. For they
              had called me mad; and during many months, as I
              understood, a solitary cell had been my
              habitation.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Liberty,
              however, had been an useless gift to me, had I
              not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time
              awakened to revenge. As the memory of past
              misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on
              their cause—the
              monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon
              whom I had sent abroad into the world for my
              destruction. I was possessed by a
              maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired
              and ardently
              prayed that I might have him within my grasp to
              wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed

<p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless
              wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of
              securing him; and for this purpose, about a month
              after my release, I repaired to a
              criminal judge in the town, and told him that I
              had an accusation to make; that I knew the destroyer
              of my family; and that I required him to exert his
              whole authority for the apprehension of the
              murderer.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and
              kindness:—"Be assured, sir," said he, "no pains
              or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover
              the villain."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I thank you," replied I; "listen, therefore, to
              the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a
              tale so strange, that I should fear you would not
              credit it, were there not something in truth which,
              however wonderful, forces conviction. The
              story is too connected to be mistaken for a
              dream, and I have no motive for falsehood." My
              manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but
              calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to
              pursue my destroyer to death; and this purpose
              quieted my agony, and for an interval reconciled me
              to life. I now related my history, briefly, but with
              firmness and precision, marking the dates with
              accuracy, and never deviating into invective or
              exclamation.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly
              incredulous, but as I continued he became more
              attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder
              with horror, at others a lively surprise, unmingled
              with disbelief, was painted on his
              countenance.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>When I had concluded my narration, I said, "This
              is the being whom I accuse, and for whose seizure and
              punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power.
              It
              is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and
              hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from
              the execution of those functions on this
              occasion."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>This address caused a
              considerable change in the physiognomy of my own
              auditor. He had heard my story with that
              half kind of belief that is given to a tale of
              spirits and supernatural events; but when he was
              called upon to act officially in consequence, the
              whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however,
              answered mildly, "I would willingly afford you every
              aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you
              speak appears to have powers which would put all my
              exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which
              can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and
              dens where no man would venture to intrude? Besides,
              some months have elapsed since the commission of his
              crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
              has wandered, or what region he may now inhabit."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which
              I inhabit; and if he has indeed taken refuge in the
              Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and
              destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your
              thoughts: you
              do not credit my narrative, and do not intend to
              pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his
              desert."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the
              magistrate was intimidated:—"You are mistaken,"
              said he, "I will exert myself; if it is in my power
              to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer
              punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear,
              from what you have yourself described to be his
              properties, that this will prove impracticable, and
              thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you
              should make up your mind to disappointment."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of
              little avail. My revenge is of no moment to you; yet,
              while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is
              the
              devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is
              unspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer, whom I
              have turned loose upon society, still exists. You
              refuse my just demand: I have but one resource; and I
              devote myself, either in my life or death, to his
              destruction."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said
              this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something,
              I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which
              
              the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.
              But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied
              by far other ideas than those of devotion and
              heroism, this
              elevation of mind had much the appearance of
              madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse
              does a child, and reverted to my tale as the effects
              of delirium.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy
              pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you
              say."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and
              retired to meditate on some other mode of action.</p>
