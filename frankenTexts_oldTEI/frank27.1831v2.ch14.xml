            <item>
               <p>"SOME time elapsed
              before I learned the history of my friends. It was
              one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on
              my mind, unfolding as it did a number of
              circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one
              so utterly inexperienced as I was.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was
              descended from a good family in France, where he had
              lived for many years in affluence, respected by his
              superiors, and beloved by his equals. His
              son was bred in the service of his country; and
              Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest
              distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had
              lived in a large and luxurious city, called Paris,
              surrounded by friends, and possessed of every
              enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or
              taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could
              afford.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The father of Safie had been the cause of their
              ruin. He was a Turkish merchant, and had inhabited
              Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I
              could not learn, he became obnoxious
              to the government. He was seized and cast into
              prison the very day that Safie
              arrived from Constantinople to join him. He
              was tried, and condemned to death. The injustice
              of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was
              indignant; and it was judged that his religion and
              wealth, rather than the crime alleged against him,
              had been the cause of his condemnation.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Felix had
              accidentally been present at the trial; his horror
              and indignation were uncontrollable, when he heard
              the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a
              solemn
              vow to deliver him, and then looked around for
              the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain
              admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated
              window in an unguarded part of the building, which
              lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan;
              who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the
              execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited
              the grate at night, and made known to the prisoner
              his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and
              delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his
              deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix
              rejected his offers with contempt; yet when he saw
              the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her
              father, and who, by her gestures, expressed her
              lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to
              his own mind, that the captive possessed a treasure
              which would fully reward his toil and hazard.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that
              his daughter had made on the heart of Felix, and
              endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his
              interests by the promise of her hand in marriage, so
              soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.
              Felix
              was too delicate to accept this offer; yet he
              looked forward to the probability of the event as to
              that consummation of his happiness.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"During the ensuing days, while the preparations
              were going forward for the escape of the merchant,
              the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that
              he received from this lovely girl, who found means to
              express her thoughts in the language of her lover by
              the aid of an old man, a servant of her father, who
              understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent
              terms for his intended services towards her parent;
              and at the same time deeply deplored her own
              fate.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I have copies of
              these letters; for I found means, during my residence
              in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing;
              and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or
              Agatha. Before I depart, I will give them to you,
              they
              will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,
              as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have
              time to repeat the substance of them to you.</p>

               <p>"Safie related, that her mother was a Christian
              Arab, seized and made a
              slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty,
              she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who
              married her. The young girl spoke in high and
              enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in
              freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now
              reduced. She
              instructed her daughter in the tenets of her
              religion, and taught her to aspire to higher
              powers of intellect, and an independence of spirit,
              forbidden
              to the female followers of Mahomet. This lady
              died; but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the
              mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
              returning to Asia, and being immured within the walls
              of a haram, allowed only to occupy herself with
              infantile amusements, ill suited to the temper of her
              soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
              emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a
              Christian, and remaining in a country where women
              were allowed to take a rank in society, was
              enchanting to her.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed;
              but, on the night previous to it, he quitted his
              prison, and before morning was distant many leagues
              from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name
              of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously
              communicated his plan to the former, who aided the
              deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a
              journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in
              an obscure part of Paris.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Felix conducted
              the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across
              Mont Cenis to Leghorn,
              where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
              opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish
              dominions.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Safie resolved to remain with her father until
              the moment of his departure, before which time the
              Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to
              his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in
              expectation of that event; and in the mean time he
              enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited
              towards him the simplest and tenderest affection.
              They conversed with one another through the means of
              an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation
              of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of
              her native country.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The Turk allowed this
              intimacy to take place, and encouraged the hopes of
              the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed
              far other plans. He loathed the idea that his
              daughter should be united to a Christian; but he
              feared the resentment of Felix, if he should appear
              lukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power
              of his deliverer, if he should choose to betray him
              to the
              Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved a
              thousand plans by which he should be enabled to
              prolong the deceit until it might be no longer
              necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him
              when he departed. His plans were facilitated by the
              news which arrived from Paris.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The government of
              France were greatly enraged at the escape of their
              victim, and spared no pains to detect and punish his
              deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered,
              and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The
              news reached Felix, and roused him from his dream of
              pleasure. His blind and aged father, and his gentle
              sister, lay in a noisome dungeon, while he enjoyed
              the free air, and the society of her whom he loved.
              This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged
              with the Turk, that if the latter should find a
              favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could
              return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at
              a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely
              Arabian, he hastened to Paris, and delivered himself
              up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De
              Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"He did not succeed. They remained confined for
              five months before the
              trial took place; the result of which deprived
              them of their fortune, and condemned them to a
              perpetual
              exile from their native country.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in
              Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon learned
              that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family
              endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering
              that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and
              ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour,
              and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly
              sending Felix a pittance of money, to aid him, as he
              said, in some plan of future maintenance.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of
              Felix, and rendered him, when I first saw him, the
              most miserable of his family. He could have endured
              poverty; and while this distress had been the meed of
              his virtue, he gloried in it: but the ingratitude of
              the Turk, and the loss of his beloved Safie, were
              misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The arrival
              of the Arabian now infused new life into his
              soul.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"When the news
              reached Leghorn, that Felix was deprived
              of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded
              his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to
              prepare to return to her native country. The generous
              nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she
              attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left
              her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's
              apartment, and told her hastily, that he had reason
              to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been
              divulged, and that he should speedily be delivered up
              to the French government; he had consequently hired a
              vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which
              city he should sail in a few hours. He intended to
              leave his daughter under the care of a confidential
              servant, to follow at her leisure with the
              greater part of his property, which had not yet
              arrived at Leghorn.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the
              plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in
              this emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent
              to her; her religion and her feelings were alike
              adverse to it. By some papers of her father, which
              fell into her hands, she heard of the exile of her
              lover, and learnt the name of the spot where he then
              resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she
              formed her determination. Taking with her some jewels
              that belonged to her, and a sum of money, she quitted
              Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who
              understood the common language of Turkey, and
              departed for Germany.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty
              leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her
              attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie
              nursed her with the most devoted affection; but
              the
              poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone,
              unacquainted with the language of the country, and
              utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She
              fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had
              mentioned the name of the spot for which they were
              bound; and, after her death, the woman of the house
              in which they had lived took care that Safie should
              arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.</p>
