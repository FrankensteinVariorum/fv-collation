<p>August
              26th, 17--.</p>
<p>YOU have read this strange and terrific story,
              Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congealed
              with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?
              Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not
              continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet
              piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so
              replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were
              now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to
              downcast sorrow, and quenched in infinite
              wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded
              his countenance and tones, and related the most
              horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing
              every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano
              bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an
              expression of the wildest rage, as he shrieked out
              imprecations on his persecutor.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His tale is connected, and told with an appearance
              of the simplest truth; yet I own to you that
              the
              letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,
              and the apparition
              of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me
              a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative
              than his asseverations, however earnest and
              connected. Such a monster has then really existence!
              I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and
              admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from
              Frankenstein the particulars of his creature's
              formation; but on this point he was impenetrable.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Are you
              mad, my friend?" said he; "or whither does your
              senseless
              curiosity lead you? Would you also create for
              yourself and the world a demoniacal
              enemy? Peace, peace! learn my miseries, and do
              not seek to increase your own."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes
              concerning his history: he asked to see them, and
              then himself corrected
              and augmented them in many places; but
              principally in
              giving the life and spirit to the conversations
              he held with his enemy. "Since you have preserved my
              narration," said he, "I would not that a mutilated
              one should go down to posterity."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened
              to the
              strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My
              thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been
              drunk up by the interest
              for my guest, which this tale, and his own
              elevated and gentle manners, have created. I wish to
              soothe him; yet can I counsel one so infinitely
              miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation,
              to live? Oh, no! the only joy that he can now know
              will be when he composes his shattered spirit to
              peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the
              offspring
              of solitude and delirium: he believes, that, when
              in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and
              derives from that communion consolation for his
              miseries, or excitements
              to his vengeance, that they are not the creations
              of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him
              from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives
              a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me
              almost
              as imposing and interesting as truth.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Our conversations are not always confined to his
              own history and misfortunes. On every point of
              general literature he displays unbounded knowledge,
              and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence
              is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he
              relates a pathetic incident, or endeavours
              to move the passions of pity or love, without
              tears. What a
              glorious creature must he have been in the days
              of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike
              in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth, and the
              greatness of his fall.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"When younger," said
              he, "I believed myself destined
              for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound;
              but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me
              for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the
              worth of my nature supported me, when others would
              have been oppressed; for I deemed it criminal to
              throw away in useless grief those talents that might
              be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on
              the work I had completed, no less a one than the
              creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could
              not rank myself with the
              herd of common projectors. But this thought,
              which supported me in the commencement of my career,
              now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All
              my speculations and hopes are as nothing; and,
              like
              the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
              chained in an eternal hell. My imagination
              was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application
              were intense; by the union of these qualities I
              conceived the idea, and executed the creation of a
              man. Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my
              reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven
              in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now
              burning with the idea of their effects. From my
              infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
              ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you
              had known me as I once was, you would not recognise
              me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely
              visited my heart; a
              high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,
              never, never again to rise."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Must I then lose this admirable being? I
              have longed for a friend; I have sought one who
              would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these
              desert seas I have found such a one; but, I fear, I
              have gained him only to know his value, and lose him.
              I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the
              idea.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I thank you, Walton," he said, "for your kind
              intentions towards so
              miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new
              ties, and fresh affections, think you that any can
              replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as
              Clerval was; or any woman another Elizabeth? Even
              where the
              affections are not strongly moved by any superior
              excellence, the companions of our childhood always
              possess a certain power over our minds, which hardly
              any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine
              dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards
              modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of
              our actions with more certain conclusions as to the
              integrity of our motives. A
              sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such
              symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of
              fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however
              strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of
              himself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I
              enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and
              association, but from their own merits; and, wherever
              I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth, and the
              conversation of Clerval, will be ever whispered in my
              ear. They are dead; and but one feeling in such a
              solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I
              were engaged in any high undertaking or design,
              fraught with extensive utility to my
              fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But
              such
              is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the
              being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth
              will be fulfilled, and I may die."</p>
</item>
<item>My beloved Sister,

              <p>I write to you, encompassed by peril, and ignorant
              whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England,
              and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am
              surrounded by mountains of ice, which admit of no
              escape, and threaten every moment to crush my vessel.
              The brave fellows, whom I have persuaded to be my
              companions, look towards me for aid; but I have none
              to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in
              our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert
              me. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of
              all these men are endangered through me. If we are
              lost, my
              mad schemes are the cause.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>And what, Margaret, will be the state of your
              mind? You
              will not hear of my destruction, and you will
              anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you
              will have visitings of despair, and yet be tortured
              by hope. Oh! my beloved sister, the sickening failing
              of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more
              terrible to me than my own death. But you have
              a
              husband, and lovely children; you may be happy:
              Heaven bless you, and make you so!</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>My unfortunate guest regards me with the
              tenderest compassion. He endeavours to fill me
              with hope; and talks as if life were a possession
              which he valued. He reminds me how often the same
              accidents have happened to other navigators, who have
              attempted this sea, and, in spite of myself, he fills
              me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel
              the
              power of his eloquence: when he speaks, they no
              longer despair; he rouses their energies, and, while
              they hear his voice, they believe these vast
              mountains of ice are mole-hills, which will vanish
              before the resolutions of man. These feelings are
              transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills
              them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by
              this despair.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest,
              that although it is highly probable that these papers
              may never reach you, yet I
              cannot forbear recording it.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We are still surrounded
              by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of
              being crushed in their conflict. The cold is
              excessive, and many
              of my unfortunate comrades have already found a
              grave amidst this scene of desolation.
              Frankenstein has daily declined in health: a
              feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes; but he
              is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused to any
              exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent
              lifelessness.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I mentioned in my last letter the
              fears I entertained of a mutiny. This morning, as
              I sat watching the wan countenance of my
              friend—his eyes half closed, and his limbs
              hanging listlessly,—I was roused by half a
              dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the
              cabin. They entered, and their leader addressed me.
              He told me that he and his companions had been chosen
              by the other sailors to come in deputation to me, to
              make me a requisition, which, in justice, I could not
              refuse. We were immured in ice, and should probably
              never escape; but they feared that if, as was
              possible, the ice should dissipate, and a free
              passage be opened, I should be rash enough to
              continue my voyage, and lead them into fresh dangers,
              after they might happily have surmounted this. They
              insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a
              solemn promise, that if the vessel should be freed I
              would instantly direct my course southward.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>This speech troubled me. I had not despaired; nor
              had I yet conceived the idea of returning, if set
              free. Yet could I, in
              justice, or even in possibility, refuse this
              demand? I hesitated before I answered; when
              Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and,
              indeed, appeared hardly to have force enough to
              attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and
              his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning
              towards the men, he said—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"What do you mean? What do you demand of your
              captain? Are you then so easily turned from your
              design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition?
              And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way
              was smooth
              and placid as a southern sea, but because it was
              full of dangers and terror; because, at every new
              incident, your fortitude was to be called forth, and
              your courage exhibited; because danger and death
              surrounded it, and these you were to brave and
              overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this was it
              an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be
              hailed as the benefactors
              of your species; your name adored, as belonging
              to brave men who encountered death for honour, and
              the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the
              first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the
              first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you
              shrink away, and are content to be handed down as men
              who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril;
              and so, poor souls, they were chilly, and returned to
              their warm fire-sides. Why, that requires not this
              preparation; ye need not have come thus far, and
              dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat, merely
              to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! be
              men, or be more than men. Be
              steady to your purposes, and firm as a rock. This
              ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be;
              it is mutable, and cannot withstand you, if you say
              that it shall not. Do not return to your families
              with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows.
              Return, as heroes who have fought and conquered, and
              who know not what it is to turn their backs on the
              foe."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the
              different feelings expressed in his speech, with
              an eye
              so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you
              wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one
              another, and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told
              them to retire, and consider of what had been said:
              that I
              would not lead them farther north, if they
              strenuously desired the contrary; but that I hoped
              that, with reflection, their
              courage would return.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>They retired, and I turned towards my friend; but
              he was sunk in languor, and almost deprived of
              life.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>How all this will terminate, I know not; but I had
              rather die than return shamefully,—my purpose
              unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the
              men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour,
              can never willingly continue to endure their present
              hardships.</p>
<p>September 7th.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The
              die is cast; I have consented to return, if we
              are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted by
              cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant
              and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I
              possess, to bear this injustice
              with patience.</p>
<p>September 12th.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It is past; I am returning to
              England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory;
              — I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour
              to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear
              sister; and while I am wafted towards England, and
              towards you, I will not despond.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings
              like thunder were heard at a distance, as the
              islands split and cracked in every direction. We were
              in the most imminent peril; but, as we could only
              remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my
              unfortunate guest, whose illness increased in such a
              degree, that he was entirely confined to his bed. The
              ice cracked behind us, and was driven with force
              towards the north; a breeze sprung from the west, and
              on the 11th the passage towards the south became
              perfectly free. When the sailors saw this, and that
              their return to their native country was apparently
              assured, a
              shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and
              long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke,
              and asked the cause of the tumult. "They shout," I
              said, "because they will soon return to England."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Do you then really return?"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Alas! yes; I cannot withstand their demands.
              I
              cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I
              must return."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Do so, if you will; but I
              will not. You may give up your purpose, but
              mine
              is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am
              weak; but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance
              will endow me with sufficient strength." Saying this,
              he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the
              exertion was too great for him; he fell back, and
              fainted.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It was long before he was restored; and I often
              thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he
              opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty, and was
              unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a
              composing draught, and ordered us to leave him
              undisturbed. In the mean time he told me, that my
              friend had not many hours to live.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His sentence was pronounced; and I could only
              grieve, and be patient. I sat by his bed, watching
              him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept;
              but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and,
              bidding me come near, said—"Alas! the strength
              I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die,
              and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in
              being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of
              my existence I feel that
              burning hatred, and ardent desire of revenge, I
              once expressed; but I feel myself justified in
              desiring the death of my adversary. During these last
              days I have been occupied in examining
              my past conduct; nor do I find it blameable. In
              a fit of
              enthusiastic madness I created a rational
              creature, and was bound towards him, to assure, as
              far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being.
              This
              was my duty; but there was another still
              paramount to that. My duties towards the beings of my
              own species had greater
              claims to my attention, because they included a
              greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by
              this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to
              create a companion for the first creature. He showed
              unparalleled malignity and selfishness, in evil: he
              destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction
              beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness,
              and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for
              vengeance may end. Miserable
              himself, that he may render no other wretched, he
              ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine,
              but I have failed. When actuated
              by selfishness and vicious motives, I asked you
              to undertake my unfinished work; and I renew this
              request now, when I am only induced by reason and
              virtue.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and
              friends, to fulfil this task; and now, that you are
              returning to England, you will have little chance of
              meeting with him. But the consideration of these
              points, and the
              well balancing of what you may esteem your
              duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are
              already disturbed by the near approach of death. I
              dare not ask you to do what I think right, for
              I
              may still be misled by passion.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"That he should live to be an instrument of
              mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour,
              when I momentarily expect my release, is the only
              happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The
              forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I
              hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek
              happiness in tranquillity, and avoid ambition, even
              if it be only the apparently innocent one of
              distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries.
              Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in
              these hopes, yet
              another may succeed."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His voice became fainter as he spoke; and at
              length, exhausted by his effort, he sunk into
              silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted
              again to speak, but was unable; he pressed my hand
              feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while the
              irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his
              lips.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely
              extinction of this
              glorious spirit? What can I say, that will enable
              you to understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I
              should express would be inadequate and feeble. My
              tears flow; my
              mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
              disappointment. But I journey towards England,
              and I may there find consolation.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend?
              It
              is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the
              watch on deck scarcely stir. Again; there is a sound
              as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the
              cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I
              must arise, and examine. Good night, my sister.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Great God! what a
              scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with
              the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall
              have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I
              have recorded would be incomplete without this final
              and wonderful catastrophe.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my
              ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form
              which I cannot find words to describe; gigantic in
              stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
              proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was
              concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one
              vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent
              texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound
              of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of
              grief and horror, and sprung towards the window.
              Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face,
              of such loathsome, yet appalling hideousness.
              
              I shut my eyes involuntarily, and endeavoured to
              recollect what
              were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
              I
              called on him to stay.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again
              turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he
              seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and
              gesture seemed instigated by the
              wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"That is also my victim!" he exclaimed: "in his
              murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable
              series of my being is wound to its close! Oh,
              Frankenstein! generous
              and self-devoted being! what does it avail that I
              now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably
              destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovest. Alas!
              he is cold, he cannot answer me."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His voice seemed suffocated; and my
              first impulses, which had suggested to me the
              duty of obeying the dying request of my friend, in
              destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a
              mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached
              this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my
              eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and
              unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but
              the words died away on my lips. The monster continued
              to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At
              length I gathered resolution to address him in a
              pause of the tempest of his passion: "Your
              repentance," I said, "is now superfluous. If you had
              listened to the
              voice of conscience, and heeded the stings of
              remorse, before you had urged your diabolical
              vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet
              have lived."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"And do you dream?" said the dæmon; "do you
              think that I was then dead to agony and
              remorse?—He," he continued, pointing to the
              corpse, "he suffered not in the consummation of the
              deed;—oh! not the ten-thousandth portion of the
              anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of
              its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on,
              while my
              heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that
              the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart
              was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy;
              and, when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred,
              it
              did not endure the violence of the change, without
              torture such as you cannot even imagine.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"After the murder of Clerval, I returned to
              Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied
              Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror: I abhorred
              myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at
              once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments,
              dared to hope for happiness; that while he
              accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me, he
              sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions
              from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred,
              then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me
              with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I
              recollected my threat, and resolved that it should be
              accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself
              a deadly torture; but I
              was the slave, not the master, of an impulse,
              which I detested, yet could not disobey. Yet when she
              died!—nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast
              off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the
              excess of my despair. Evil
              thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far,
              I
              had no choice but to adapt my nature to an
              element which I had willingly chosen. The completion
              of my
              demoniacal design became an insatiable passion.
              And now it is ended; there is my last victim!"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I was at first touched by the expressions of his
              misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein
              had said of his
              powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I
              again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend,
              indignation was rekindled within me. "Wretch!"
              I said, "it is well that you come here to whine over
              the desolation that you have made. You
              throw a torch into a pile of buildings; and, when
              they are consumed, you sit among the ruins, and
              lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! if he whom you
              mourn still lived, still would he be the object,
              again would he become the prey, of your accursed
              vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament
              only because the victim of your malignity is
              withdrawn from your power."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Oh, it is not thus—not thus," interrupted
              the being; "yet such must be the impression conveyed
              to you by what appears to be the purport of my
              actions. Yet I
              seek not a fellow-feeling in my misery. No
              sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it
              was the
              love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and
              affection with which my whole being overflowed, that
              I
              wished to be participated. But now, that virtue
              has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and
              affection are turned into bitter and loathing
              despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am
              content to suffer alone, while my sufferings shall
              endure: when I die, I am well satisfied
              that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my
              memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of
              virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely
              hoped to meet with beings, who, pardoning my outward
              form, would love me for the excellent qualities which
              I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished with high
              thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has
              degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no
              mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found
              comparable to mine. When I run over the frightful
              catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the
              same creature whose thoughts were once filled with
              sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and
              the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the
              fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that
              enemy of God and man had friends and associates in
              his desolation; I am
              alone.</p>

<p>"You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to
              have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes.
              But, in the detail which he gave you of them, he
              could not sum up the hours and months of misery which
              I endured, wasting in impotent passions. For while I
              destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own
              desires. They
              were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired
              love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was
              there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the
              only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me?
              Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from
              his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the
              rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his
              child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings!
              I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion,
              to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even
              now my blood boils at the
              recollection of this injustice.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"But it is true that I am a wretch. I have
              murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have
              strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to
              death his throat who never injured me or any other
              living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select
              specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration
              among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that
              irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in
              death. You hate me; but your abhorrence cannot equal
              that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands
              which executed the deed; I think on the heart in
              which the imagination of it was conceived, and long
              for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes,
              when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no
              more.</p>

<item>
<p>"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future
              mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither yours
              nor any man's death is needed to consummate the
              series of my being, and accomplish that which must be
              done; but it requires my own. Do not think that I
              shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit
              your vessel on the ice-raft which brought me thither,
              and shall
              seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I
              shall collect my funeral pile, and consume to ashes
              this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no
              light to any curious and unhallowed wretch, who would
              create such another as I have been. I shall die. I
              shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume
              me, or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
              unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and
              when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us
              both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the
              sun or stars, or feel the winds play on my cheeks.
              Light,
              feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this
              condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago,
              when the images which this world affords first opened
              upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer,
              and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling
              of the birds, and these were all to me, I
              should have wept to die; now it is my only
              consolation. Polluted by crimes, and torn by the
              bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in
              death?</p>

<p>"Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of
              human kind whom these eyes will ever behold.
              Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive, and
              yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it
              would be better satiated in my life than in my
              destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my
              extinction, that I might not cause greater
              wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me,
              thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst
              not desire against me a vengeance greater than that
              which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my
              agony was still superior to thine; for the bitter
              sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
              wounds until death shall close them for ever.</p>

<p>"But soon," he cried, with sad and solemn
              enthusiasm, "I shall die, and what I now feel be no
              longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be
              extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly,
              and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The
              light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes
              will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit
              will sleep in peace; or if it thinks, it will not
              surely think thus. Farewell."</p>

<p>He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this,
              upon the ice-raft which lay close to the vessel. He
              was soon borne away by the waves, and lost in
              darkness and distance.</p>
