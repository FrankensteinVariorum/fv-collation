         <p> </p>
         <list type="simple">
            <item>
               <p> WE passed a few sad
              hours, until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to
              commence. My father and the rest of the family being
              obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to
              the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery
              of justice I suffered living torture. It
              was to be decided, whether the result of my
              curiosity
              and lawless
              devices would cause the death of two of my
              fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of innocence
              and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with
              every aggravation of infamy that could make the
              murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl
              of merit, andpossessed qualities which promised to
              render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated
              in an ignominious grave; and I
              the cause! A thousand times rather would I have
              confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to
              Justine; but I was absent when it was committed, and
              such a declaration would have been considered as the
              ravings
              of a madman, and would not have exculpated her
              who suffered through me.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>The appearance of
              Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and
              her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by
              the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.
              Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not
              tremble, although gazed
              on and execrated by thousands; for all the
              kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
              excited, was obliterated in the minds of the
              spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was
              supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her
              tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her
              confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her
              guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of
              courage. When she entered the court, she threw her
              eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we were
              seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us;
              but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of
              sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter
              guiltlessness.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>The trial began; and,
              after the advocate against her had stated the charge,
              several witnesses were called. Several strange facts
              combined against her, which might have staggered any
              one who had not such
              proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out
              the whole of the night on which the murder had been
              committed, and towards morning had been perceived by
              a market-woman not far from the spot where the body
              of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The
              woman asked her what she did there; but she looked
              very strangely, and only returned a confused
              and unintelligible answer. She returned to the
              house about eight
              o'clock; and, when one inquired where she had
              passed the night, she replied, that she had been
              looking for the child, and demanded earnestly if any
              thing had been heard concerning him. When shown the
              body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her
              bed for several days. The picture was then produced,
              which the servant had found in her pocket; and when
              Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was
              the same which, an hour before the child had been
              missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of
              horror and indignation filled the court.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Justine was called on
              for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her
              countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery
              were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with
              her tears; but, when she was desired to plead, she
              collected her powers, and spoke in an audible,
              although variable voice.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> "God knows," she said,
              "how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend
              that my protestations should acquit me: I rest my
              innocence on a plain
              and simple explanation of the facts which have
              been adduced against me; and I hope the character I
              have always borne will incline my judges to a
              favourable interpretation, where any circumstance
              appears doubtful or suspicious."</p>

            <item>
               <p>She then related that,
              by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the
              evening of the night on which the murder had been
              committed at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a
              village situated at about a league
              from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o'clock,
              she met a man, who asked her if she had seen any
              thing of the child who was lost. She was alarmed by
              this account, and passed several hours in looking for
              him, when the gates
              of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain
              several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a
              cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants,
              to whom she was well known. Most of the night she
              spent here watching; towards morning she believed
              that she slept for a few minutes; some steps
              disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and she
              quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to
              find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where
              his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she
              had been bewildered when questioned by the
              market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed
              a sleepless night, and the fate of poor William was
              yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give
              no account.</p>

            <item>
               <p>"I know," continued the
              unhappy victim, "how heavily and fatally this one
              circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power
              of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter
              ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning
              the probabilities by which it might have been placed
              in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe
              that I
              have no enemy on earth, and none surely would
              have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did
              the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity
              afforded him
              for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen
              the jewel, to
              part with it again so soon?</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I commit my cause to
              the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope.
              I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined
              concerning my character; and if their testimony shall
              not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned,
              although I
              would pledge my salvation on my innocence."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Several witnesses were
              called, who had known her for many years, and they
              spoke well of her; but fear, and hatred of the crime
              of which they supposed her guilty, rendered them
              timorous, and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth
              saw even this last resource, her excellent
              dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to
              fail the accused, when, although violently agitated,
              she desired permission to address the court.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I am," said she, "the
              cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or
              rather his sister, for I was educated by, and have
              lived with his parents ever since and even long
              before, his birth. It may therefore be judged
              indecent in me to come forward on this occasion; but
              when I see a fellow-creature about to perish through
              the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be
              allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her
              character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I
              have lived in the same house with her, at
              one time for five, and at another for nearly two
              years. During all that period she appeared to me the
              most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.
              She
              nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last
              illness, with the greatest affection and care; and
              afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious
              illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of
              all who knew her; after which she again lived in my
              uncle's house, where she was beloved by all the
              family. She was warmly attached to the child who is
              now dead, and acted towards him like a most
              affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not
              hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding all the
              evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on
              her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such
              an action: as to the bauble
              on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly
              desired it, I should have willingly given it to her;
              so much do I esteem and value her."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>A murmur of approbation
              followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal; but
              it was excited by her generous interference, and not
              in favor of poor Justine, on whom the public
              indignation was turned with renewed violence,
              charging her with the blackest
              ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke,
              but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish
              was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her
              innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon,
              who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my
              brother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed the
              innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain
              the horror of my situation; and when I perceived that
              the popular voice, and the countenances of the
              judges, had already condemned my unhappy victim, I
              rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures
              of the accused did not equal mine; she was
              sustained by innocence, but the fangs
              of remorse tore my bosom, and would not forego
              their hold.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I passed a night of
              unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the
              court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not
              ask the fatal question; but I was known, and the
              officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots
              had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was
              condemned.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I cannot pretend to
              describe what I then felt. I had before experienced
              sensations of horror; and I
              have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate
              expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of
              the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The
              person to whom I addressed myself added, that Justine
              had already confessed
              her guilt. "That evidence," he observed, "was
              hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad
              of it; and, indeed, none of our judges like to
              condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be
              it ever so decisive."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> This was strange and
              unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my
              eyes deceived me? and was I really as mad as the
              whole world would believe me to be, if I disclosed
              the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return
              home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"My cousin," replied I,
              "it is decided as you may have expected; all
              judges had rather that ten innocent should
              suffer, than that one guilty should escape. But she
              has confessed."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>This was a dire blow to
              poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon
              Justine's innocence. "Alas!" said she, "how shall I
              ever again believe in human
              goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as
              my sister, how could she put on those smiles of
              innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed
              incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has
              committed a murder."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Soon after we heard
              that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my
              cousin. My
              father wished her not to go; but said, that he
              left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide.
              "Yes," said Elizabeth, "I will go, although she is
              guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot
              go alone." The idea of this visit was torture to me,
              yet I could not refuse.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>We entered the gloomy
              prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some
              straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled,
              and her head rested on her knees. She rose on seeing
              us enter; and when we were left alone with her, she
              threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping
              bitterly. My cousin wept also.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> "Oh, Justine!" said
              she, "why did you rob me of my last consolation? I
              relied on your innocence; and although I was then
              very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am
              now."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"And do you also
              believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also
              join
              with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a
              murderer?" Her voice was suffocated with sobs.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Rise, my poor girl,"
              said Elizabeth, "why do you kneel, if you are
              innocent? I am not one of your enemies; I believed
              you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until
              I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.
              That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear
              Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you
              for a moment, but your own confession."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I did confess; but I
              confessed a lie. I
              confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but
              now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all
              my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever
              since I was condemned, my
              confessor has besieged me; he threatened and
              menaced, until I almost began to think that I
              was the monster that he said I was. He threatened
              excommunication and hell fire in my last moments, if
              I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to
              support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to
              ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil
              hour I
              subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly
              miserable."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>She paused, weeping,
              and then continued—"I thought with horror, my
              sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine,
              whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and
              whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime
              which none
              but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
              Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see
              you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and
              that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy
              and death."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Oh, Justine! forgive
              me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why did
              you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not
              fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I
              will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my
              tears and prayers. You shall not die!—You, my
              play-fellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the
              scaffold! No! no! I never could survive so horrible a
              misfortune."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Justine shook her head
              mournfully. "I do not fear to die," she said; "that
              pang is past. God
              raises my weakness, and gives me courage to
              endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and
              if you remember me, and think of me as of one
              unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate
              awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in
              patience to the will of Heaven!"</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>During this
              conversation I
              had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where
              I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.
              Despair! Who dared talked of that? The poor victim,
              who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary
              between life and death, felt
              not as I did, such deep and bitter agony.
              
              I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together,
              uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.
              Justine started. When she saw who it was, she
              approached me, and said, "Dear sir, you are very kind
              to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am
              guilty?"</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I could not answer.
              "No, Justine," said Elizabeth; "he is more convinced
              of your innocence than I was; for even when he heard
              that you had confessed, he did not credit it."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I truly thank him. In
              these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude
              towards those who think of me with kindness. How
              sweet is the affection of others to such a
              wretch as I am! It removes more than half my
              misfortune; and I feel as if I could die in peace,
              now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear
              lady, and your cousin."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Thus the poor sufferer
              tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed
              gained the resignation she desired. But I,
              the true murderer, felt the
              never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed
              of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept, and
              was unhappy; but hers also was the misery of
              innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the
              fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its
              brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into
              the core of my heart; I
              bore a hell within me, which nothing could
              extinguish. We stayed several hours with Justine; and
              it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could
              tear herself away. "I wish," cried she, "that I were
              to die with you; I
              cannot live in this world of misery."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Justine assumed an air
              of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed
              her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said,
              in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, "Farewell,
              sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my
              beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its
              bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last
              misfortune that you will ever suffer. Live, and be
              happy, and make
              others so."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>And on the morrow
              Justine died. Elizabeth's heart-rending
              eloquence failed to move the judges from their
              settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly
              sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals were
              lost upon them. And when I received their cold
              answers, and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of
              these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips.
              Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke
              the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She
              perished on the scaffold as a murderess!</p>

               <p>From the tortures of my
              own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and
              voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my
              doing! And my father's woe, and the desolation of
              that late so smiling home—all was the work of
              my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones; but
              these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise
              the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations
              shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your
              son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he
              who would spend each vital drop of blood for your
              sakes—who has no thought nor sense of joy,
              except as it is mirrored also in your dear
              countenances—who would fill the air with
              blessings, and spend his life in serving you—he
              bids you weep—to shed countless tears; happy
              beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable
              fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause
              before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your
              sad torments!</p>

               <p>Thus spoke my prophetic
              soul, as, torn
              by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those l
              loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William
              and Justine, the first hapless victims to my
              unhallowed arts.</p>
