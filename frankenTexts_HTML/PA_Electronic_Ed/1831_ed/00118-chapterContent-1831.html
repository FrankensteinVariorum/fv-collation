"Having thus arranged my dwelling, and carpeted it with clean
straw, I retired; for I saw the figure of a man at a distance,
and I remembered too well my treatment the night before, to trust
myself in his power. I had first, however, provided for my
sustenance for that day, by a loaf of coarse bread, which I
purloined, and a cup with which I could drink, more conveniently
than from my hand, of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.
The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry,
and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was
tolerably warm.</p><p>

"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel, until something
should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed <a
href="../V2notes/paradise.html">a paradise</a>, compared to the bleak
forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I
ate my breakfast with pleasure, and was about to remove a plank to procure
myself a little water, when I heard a step, and looking through a small
chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before
my hovel. The girl was young, and of gentle demeanour, <a
href="../V2notes/unlike.html">unlike what I have since found cottagers and
farm-house servants to be</a>. Yet she was <a
href="../V2notes/meanly.html">meanly dressed</a>, a coarse blue petticoat
and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited, but not
adorned; she looked patient, yet sad. I lost sight of her; and in about a
quarter of an hour she returned, bearing the pail, which was now partly
filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden,
a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.
Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her
head, and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they
disappeared. Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his
hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied,
sometimes in the house, and sometimes in the yard.</p>
