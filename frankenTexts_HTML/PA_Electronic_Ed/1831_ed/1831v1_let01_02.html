I am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of <a
href="../Places/stpeters.html">Petersburgh</a>, I feel a cold northern
breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves, and fills me with
delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled
from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of
those icy climes. <a href="../V1notes/inspired.html">Inspirited by this
wind</a> of promise, my <a href="../V1notes/daydream.html">day dreams</a>
become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the <a
href="../V1notes/pole.html">pole</a> is the seat of frost and desolation;
it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and
delight. There, Margaret, <a href="../V1notes/visible.html">the sun is for
ever visible</a>; its broad disk just skirting the horizon, and diffusing
a perpetual splendour. There -- for with your leave, my sister, I will put
some trust in preceding <a href="../V1notes/navigate.html">navigators</a>
-- there <a href="../V1notes/snow.html">snow and frost are banished</a>;
and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the
phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those
undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal
light? I may there discover the <a href="../V1notes/wonder.html">wondrous
power</a> which attracts the needle; and may regulate a thousand <a 
href="../V1notes/celest.html">celestial observations</a>, that require 
only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for 
ever. I shall satiate my <a href="../V1notes/curious.html">ardent 
curiosity</a> with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, 
and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are 
my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or 
death, and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a 
child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on 
an expedition of discovery up his native river. But, supposing all these 
conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which 
I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by discovering a <a
href="../V1notes/passage.html">passage near the pole</a> to those
countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by
ascertaining the <a href="../V1notes/magnet.html">secret of the
magnet</a>, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an
undertaking such as mine.</p>
