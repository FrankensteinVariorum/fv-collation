        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p1"/>St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p1"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p2"/>Y<hi sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p2_hi1"/>OU<hi eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p2_hi1"/> will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
          commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I
          arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare, and
          increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p2"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p3"/>I am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a
          cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves, and fills me with
          delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions
          towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this
          wind of promise, my day dreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be
          persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my
          imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever
          visible; its broad disk just skirting the horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
          There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a
          land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
          globe. Its productions and features may be without ex<pb xml:id="F1831_v_020" n="4"/>ample, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
          solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover
          the wondrous power which attracts the needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial
          observations, that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities
          consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the
          world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of
          man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or
          death, and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when
          he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
          native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the
          inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by
          discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many
          months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all
          possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p3"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p4"/>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel
          my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven; for nothing contributes so
          much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose,—a point on which the soul may fix its
          intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have
          read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect
          of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may
          remember, that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
          whole of our good uncle Thomas’s library. My education was neglected, yet I was
          passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my
          familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that
          my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring
          life.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p4"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p5"/>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions
          entranced my soul, and lifted <pb xml:id="F1831_v_021" n="5"/>it to heaven. I also became a
          poet, and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also
          might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakspeare are
          consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure, and how heavily I bore the
          disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
          thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p5"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p6"/>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now,
          remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by
          inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the
          North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked
          harder than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my nights to the study of
          mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a
          naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired
          myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must
          own I felt a little proud, when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel,
          and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so valuable did he consider my
          services.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p6"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p7"/>And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might
          have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth
          placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My
          courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often
          depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which
          will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but
          sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p7"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p8"/>This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the
          snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than
          that of an English stage-coach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs,—a
          dress which I have <pb xml:id="F1831_v_022" n="6"/>already adopted; for there is a great
          difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no
          exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to
          lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p8"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p9"/>I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to
          hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to
          engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the
          whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June: and when shall I return?
          Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps
          years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or
          never.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p9"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p10"/>Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me,
          that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p10"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter1_div1_p11"/>Your affectionate brother,<p eID="novel1_letter1_div1_p11"/>
