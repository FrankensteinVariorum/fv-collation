          advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchant-man now on its
          homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land,
          perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my <del sID="novel1_letter3_div3_p3_del1"/>men<del eID="novel1_letter3_div3_p3_del1"/>

          advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is
          the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which
          blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a
          degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected. <add sID="novel1_letter3_div3_p3_add4"/>The appearance of the sky is indiscribably beautiful; clear by day, and illuminated at night by the Aurora Borealis <del sID="novel1_letter3_div3_p3_add4_del1"/>w<del eID="novel1_letter3_div3_p3_add4_del1"/> which spreads a roseate tinge over the heavens, &amp; over the sea which reflects it’s splendour.<add eID="novel1_letter3_div3_p3_add4"/>
