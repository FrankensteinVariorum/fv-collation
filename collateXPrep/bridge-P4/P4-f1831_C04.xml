            LETTER III.To Mrs.
            Saville, England.July 7th, 17—.
            MY DEAR
            SISTER,
            I WRITE a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe,
            and well advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a 
            merchantman 
            now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may
            not see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my 
            men 
            are 
            bold, and apparently 
            firm of purpose; nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass
            us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to
            dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of
            summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us
            speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of
            renovating warmth which I had not 
            expected.
            No 
            incidents have hitherto befallen 
            us 
            that would make a figure in a letter. One or 
            two stiff 
            gales, and the 
            springing 
            of a 
            leak, 
            are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record;
            and I shall be well 
            content 
            if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.
            Adieu, my
            dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as 
            yours, 
            I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and 
            prudent.
            But success shall crown my endeavours. Wherefore
            not? Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas: the very stars
            themselves being witnesses and testimonies of 
            my 
            triumph. Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What
            can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?
            My swelling
            heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish. Heaven bless my beloved
            sister!
            R.W.
