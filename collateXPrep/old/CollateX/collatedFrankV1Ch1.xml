IChapter 1 I AM by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him<app><rdg wit="Ed1818"/><rdg wit="Ed1831">,</rdg></app>for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; and<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">it</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor</rdg></app>was<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">not</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">it</rdg></app>until the decline of life that he<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">thought of marrying, and bestowing on the state sons who might carry his virtues and his name down to posterity</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">became a husband and the father of a family</rdg></app>.As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">grieved also for the loss of</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">bitterly deplored the false pride which led</rdg></app>his<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">society, and resolved</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring</rdg></app>to seek him out<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">and endeavour to persuade</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">, with the hope of persuading</rdg></app>him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house. The interval was<app><rdg wit="Ed1818"/><rdg wit="Ed1831">,</rdg></app>consequently<app><rdg wit="Ed1818"/><rdg wit="Ed1831">,</rdg></app><app><rdg wit="Ed1818">spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care, and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831"/></app><app><rdg wit="Ed1818"/><rdg wit="Ed1831">spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of support.

There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly</rdg></app>to<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">all his labours and utility. No creature could have more tender parents than mine. My improvement and health were their constant care, especially as I remained for several years their only child. But before I continue my narrative, I must record an incident which took place when I was four</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">love strongly. Perhaps during former</rdg></app>years<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">of age.My father</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">he</rdg></app>had<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">a sister, whom he tenderly loved</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved</rdg></app>, and<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">who had married early</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship</rdg></app>in<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">life an Italian gentleman. Soon after her marriage</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">his attachment to my mother</rdg></app>,<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">she had accompanied</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing</rdg></app>her<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">husband into his native country, and for some years my father had very little communication with</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to</rdg></app>her.<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">About the time I mentioned she died; and a few months afterwards he received a letter from her husband, acquainting him with his intention of marrying an Italian lady</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind</rdg></app>, and<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">requesting my father to take charge of the infant Elizabeth,</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even</rdg></app>the<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">only child of his deceased sister. "It is my wish," he said</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit</rdg></app>,<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">"that you should consider her as your own daughter, and educate her thus. Her mother's fortune is secured to her, the documents of which I will commit to your keeping. Reflect upon this proposition</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions</rdg></app>; and<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">decide whether you would prefer educating your niece yourself to her being brought up by a stepmother."My father did not hesitate, and</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831"/></app>immediately<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">went to Italy, that he might accompany the little Elizabeth to</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for</rdg></app>her<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">future home</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">weakened frame.From Italy they visited Germany and France</rdg></app>. I<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">have often heard my mother say, that she was</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">, their eldest child, was born</rdg></app>at<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">that time the most beautiful child she had ever seen, and shewed signs even then of a gentle and affectionate disposition. These indications, and a desire to bind</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">Naples, and</rdg></app>as<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">closely as possible the ties of domestic</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of</rdg></app>love<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">, determined my mother</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831"/></app>to<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">consider Elizabeth as my future wife; a design which she never found reason to repent.From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">bestow them upon me. My mother's tender caresses, and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are</rdg></app>my<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">playfellow, and, as we grew older, my friend. She was docile</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent</rdg></app>and<app><rdg wit="Ed1818"/><rdg wit="Ed1831">helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to</rdg></app>good<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect. Although she was lively and animated, her feelings were strong and</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this</rdg></app>deep<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">, and her disposition uncommonly affectionate. No one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could submit with more grace than she did</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">consciousness of what they owed towards the being</rdg></app>to<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">constraint and caprice. Her imagination was luxuriant</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">which they had given life</rdg></app>,<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">yet her capability</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">added to the active spirit</rdg></app>of<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">application was great. Her person was the image of her mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird's, possessed an attractive softness. Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and</rdg></app>of<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">enduring great fatigue, she appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired her understanding and fancy</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">self-control</rdg></app>, I<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">loved to tend on her, as I should on a favourite animal; and I never saw</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">was</rdg></app>so<app><rdg wit="Ed1818"/><rdg wit="Ed1831">guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.For a long time I was their only care. My mother had</rdg></app>much<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">grace both</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">desire to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers</rdg></app>of<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">person and mind united to so little pretension.Every one adored Elizabeth. If the servants had any request to make, it was always through her intercession. We were strangers to any species of disunion and dispute; for although there was a great dissimilitude in our characters, there was an harmony in that very dissimilitude. I was</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was</rdg></app>more<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">calm and philosophical</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831"/></app>than<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">my companion</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">a duty</rdg></app>;<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">yet my temper was not so yielding. My application was of longer endurance; but it was not so severe whilst it endured. I delighted</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">it was a necessity, a passion,—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,— for her to act</rdg></app>in<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">investigating</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">her turn</rdg></app>the<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">facts relative</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">guardian angel</rdg></app>to the<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">actual world; she busied herself in following the aërial creations of the poets. The world was to me a secret, which I desired to discover; to her it was a vacancy</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan</rdg></app>,<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">which she sought to people with imaginations of her own</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode</rdg></app>.<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">My brothers were considerably younger than myself; but I had</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing</rdg></app>a<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">friend in one of</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted</rdg></app>my<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">schoolfellows, who compensated for this deficiency. Henry Clerval was</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">mother far above all</rdg></app>the<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">son</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">rest. She appeared</rdg></app>of a<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">merchant of Geneva, an intimate friend of my father. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. I remember, when he</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child</rdg></app>was<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">nine years old, he wrote a fairy tale, which</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">thin, and very fair. Her hair</rdg></app>was the<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">delight and amazement of all his companions. His favourite study consisted in books</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown</rdg></app>of<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">chivalry and romance; and when very young, I can remember, that we used to act plays composed by him out</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding</rdg></app>of<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">these favourite books, the principal characters</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">her face so expressive</rdg></app>of<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">which were Orlando</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">sensibility and sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species</rdg></app>,<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">Robin Hood, Amadis</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">a being heaven-sent</rdg></app>, and<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">St. George.No youth could have passed more happily than mine. My parents were indulgent, and my companions amiable. Our studies were never forced; and by some means we always had an end placed in view</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl</rdg></app>,<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">which excited us to ardour in the prosecution of them. It was by this method</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">eagerly communicated her history. She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German</rdg></app>, and<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">not by emulation, that we were urged</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people</rdg></app>to<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">application. Elizabeth was not incited to apply herself to drawing, that her companions might not outstrip her;</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was</rdg></app>but<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">through the desire of pleasing her aunt</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy</rdg></app>,<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">by the representation of some favourite scene done by her own hand. We learned Latin and English, that we might read</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">—one among</rdg></app>the<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">writings in those languages; and so far from study being made odious</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">schiavi ognor frementi , who exerted himself</rdg></app>to<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">us through punishment, we loved application, and our amusements would have been the labours</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim</rdg></app>of<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">other children. Perhaps we did not read so many books</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">its weakness. Whether he had died</rdg></app>, or<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">learn languages so quickly, as those who are disciplined according to the ordinary methods; but what we learned was impressed the more deeply on our memories</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">still lingered in the dungeons of Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles</rdg></app>.<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">In this description of our domestic circle I include Henry Clerval; for he was constantly with us. He went to school with me, and generally passed the afternoon at our house: for being an only child, and destitute of companions at home, his father was well pleased that he should find associates at our house; and we</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa, a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks, and whose form and motions</rdg></app>were<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">never completely happy when Clerval</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition</rdg></app>was<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">absent</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her</rdg></app>.<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">I feel pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty</rdg></app>and<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">narrow reflections upon self. But, in drawing</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">want, when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became</rdg></app>the<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">picture</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">inmate</rdg></app>of my<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">early days, I must not omit to record those events which led, by insensible steps to my after tale</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">parents' house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion</rdg></app>of<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which afterwards ruled</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">all my occupations and</rdg></app>my<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">pleasures.Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate</rdg></app>and almost<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">forgotten sources; but, swelling as</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared</rdg></app>it<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age, we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon: the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,—'I have</rdg></app>a<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">pretty present for my Victor—to-morrow he shall have it</rdg></app>.<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">' And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness</rdg></app>,<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. I cannot help remarking here the many opportunities instructors possess of directing the attention of their pupils to useful knowledge, which they utterly neglect. My father</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">interpreted her words literally, and</rdg></app>looked<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">carelessly at the title-page of my book</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love</rdg></app>, and<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">said, "Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash."If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me, that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a modern system of science had been introduced, which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical; under such circumstances, I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and, with my imagination warmed as it was, should probably have applied myself to the more rational theory of chemistry which has resulted from modern discoveries. It is even possible, that the train of my ideas would never have</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I</rdg></app>received<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word,</rdg></app>no<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents; and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few beside myself; and although I have often wished to communicate these secret stores of knowledge to my father, yet his indefinite censure of my favourite Agrippa always withheld me. I disclosed my discoveries to Elizabeth, therefore, under a promise of strict secrecy; but she did not interest herself in the subject, and I was left by her to pursue my studies alone.It may appear very strange, that a disciple of Albertus Magnus should arise in the eighteenth century; but our family was not scientifical, and I had not attended any of the lectures given at the schools of Geneva. My dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life. But the latter obtained my undivided attention: wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend the discovery, if I could banish disease from the human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfillment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.The natural phænomena that take place every day before our eyes did not escape my examinations. Distillation, and the wonderful effects of steam, processes of which my favourite authors were utterly ignorant, excited my astonishment; but my utmost wonder was engaged by some experiments on an air-pump, which I saw employed by a gentleman whom we were in the habit of visiting.The ignorance of the early philosophers on these and several other points served to decrease their credit with me: but I could not entirely throw them aside, before some other system should occupy their place in my mind.When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunder-storm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak, which</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she</rdg></app>stood<app><rdg wit="Ed1818">about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbands of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.The catastrophe of this tree excited my extreme astonishment; and I eagerly inquired of my father the nature and origin of thunder and lightning. He replied, "Electricity;" describing at the same time the various effects of that power. He constructed a small electrical machine, and exhibited a few experiments; he made also a kite, with a wire and string, which drew down that fluid from the clouds.This last stroke completed the overthrow of Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, who had so long reigned the lords of my imagination. But by some fatality I did not feel inclined to commence the study of any modern system; and this disinclination was influenced by the following circumstance.My father expressed a wish that I should attend a course of lectures upon natural philosophy, to which I cheerfully consented. Some accident prevented my attending these lectures until the course was nearly finished. The lecture, being therefore one of the last, was entirely incomprehensible to me. The professor discoursed with the greatest fluency of potassium and boron, of sulphates and oxyds, terms to which I could affix no idea; and I became disgusted with the science of natural philosophy, although I still read Pliny and Buffon with delight, authors, in my estimation, of nearly equal interest and utility.My occupations at this age were principally the mathematics, and most of the branches of study appertaining to that science. I was busily employed in learning languages; Latin was already familiar to me, and I began to read some of the easiest Greek authors without the help of a lexicon. I also perfectly understood English and German. This is the list of my accomplishments at the age of seventeen; and you may conceive that my hours were fully employed in acquiring and maintaining a knowledge of this various literature.Another task also devolved upon me, when I became the instructor of my brothers. Ernest was six years younger than myself, and was my principal pupil. He had been afflicted with ill health from his infancy, through which Elizabeth and I had been his constant nurses: his disposition was gentle, but he was incapable of any severe application. William, the youngest of our family, was yet an infant, and the most beautiful little fellow in the world; his lively blue eyes, dimpled cheeks, and endearing manners, inspired the tenderest affection.Such was our domestic circle, from which care and pain seemed for ever banished. My father directed our studies, and my mother partook of our enjoyments. Neither of us possessed the slightest pre-eminence over the other; the voice of command was never heard amongst us; but mutual affection engaged us all to comply with and obey the slightest desire of each other</rdg><rdg wit="Ed1831">to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only</rdg></app>.&lt; Letter IV | Chapter 2 &gt;</cx:apparatus>
