   <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">MY DEAREST FRIEND</hi>,</p>
   <p>“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you
            are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a
            fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered! I expect to see you looking
            even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,
            tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your
            countenance, and to find that your heart is not totally devoid of comfort and
            tranquillity.</p>
   <p>“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago,
            even perhaps augmented by <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_101" n="097"/>time. I would not
            disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you; but a conversation
            that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary
            before we meet.</p>
   <p>“Explanation! you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really
            say this, my questions are answered, and I have no more to do than to sign myself your
            affectionate cousin. But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread,
            and yet be pleased with this explanation; and, in a probability of this being the case,
            I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to
            express to you, but have never had the courage to begin.</p>
   <p>“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_102" n="098"/>your parents ever since our infancy. We were told
            this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
            place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and
            valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often
            entertain a lively affection towards each other, without desiring a more intimate union,
            may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you, by our
            mutual happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?</p>
   <p>“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I
            confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to
            solitude, from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_103" n="099"/>might regret our connexion, and believe yourself
            bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves
            to your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my cousin, that I
            love you, and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and
            companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own, when I declare to you,
            that our marriage would render me eternally miserable, unless it were the dictate of
            your own free choice. Even now I weep to think, that, borne down as you are by the
            cruelest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word <hi rend="italic">honour</hi>, all
            hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who have
            so <add place="gutter">dis</add>interested an affection for you, may increase your miseries ten-fold, by being an
            obstacle to your wishes. Ah, Vic<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_104" n="100"/>tor, be assured
            that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by
            this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain
            satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.</p>
   <p>“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer it to-morrow, or the next day, or even
            until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle will send me news of your health; and
            if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other
            exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.</p>
   <p>“E<hi rend="smallcaps">LIZABETH</hi> L<hi rend="smallcaps">AVENZA</hi>.</p>
   <p>“Geneva, May 18th, 17—.”</p>
   <p>This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_105" n="101"/>of the fiend—“<hi rend="italic">I will be with you
              on your wedding-night!</hi>” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the dæmon
            employ every art to destroy me, and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised
            partly to console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate his
            crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place,
            in which if he was victorious, I should be at peace, and his power over me be at an end.
            If he were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! what freedom? such as the peasant
            enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands
            laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, pennyless, and alone, but free. Such
            would be my liberty, except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure; alas! balanced
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_106" n="102"/>by those horrors of remorse and guilt, which
            would pursue me until death.</p>
   <p>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and re-read her letter, and some softened feelings
            stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisaical dreams of love and joy; but the
            apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I
            would die to make her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable;
            yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might
            indeed arrive a few months sooner; but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed
            it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other, and perhaps more dreadful
            means of revenge. He had vowed <hi rend="italic">to be with me on my wedding-night</hi>,
            yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_107" n="103"/>the mean time; for, as if to shew me that he was not yet satiated with
            blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats. I
            resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to
            her’s or my father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard
            it a single hour.</p>
   <p>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. “I
            fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that
            I may one day enjoy is concentered in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I
            consecrate my life, and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
            dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far
            from being <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_108" n="104"/>surprised at my misery, you will only
            wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror
            to you the day after our marriage shall take place; for, my sweet cousin, there must be
            perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude
            to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”</p>
   <p>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter, we returned to Geneva. My
            cousin welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were in her eyes, as she beheld my
            emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner, and
            had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness,
            and soft looks of compassion, made her a more fit companion for one blasted and
            miserable as I was.</p>
   <p>
      <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_109" n="105"/>The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not
            endure. Memory brought madness with it; and when I thought of what had passed, a real
            insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious, and burnt with rage, sometimes low and
            despondent. I neither spoke or looked, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude
            of miseries that overcame me.</p>
   <p>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe
            me when transported by passion, and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.
            She wept with me, and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour
            to inspire me with resignation. Ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but
            for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_110" n="106"/>otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of
            grief.</p>
   <p>Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with my cousin. I
            remained silent.</p>
   <p>“Have you, then, some other attachment?”</p>
   <p>“None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union with delight. Let the
            day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the
            happiness of my cousin.”</p>
   <p>“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us; but let us only
            cling closer to what remains, and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those
            who yet live. Our circle will be small, but bound close by the ties of affection and
            mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, new <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_111" n="107"/>and dear objects of care will be born to replace
            those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.”</p>
   <p>Such were the <del rend="strikethrough">lessons of</del><add place="margin">views</add> my father <add place="margin">entertained</add>. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned:
            nor can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I
            should almost regard him as invincible; and that when he had pronounced the words, “<hi rend="italic">I shall be with you on your wedding-night</hi>,” I should regard the
            threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me, if the loss of Elizabeth
            were balanced with it; and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance,
            agreed with my father, that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place
            in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.</p>
   <p>Great God! if for one instant I <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_112" n="108"/>had thought what
            might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished
            myself for ever from my native country, and wandered a friendless outcast over the
            earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic
            powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I
            prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.</p>
   <p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic
            feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of
            hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly
            deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union
            with placid contentment, not <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_113" n="109"/>unmingled with a
            little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and
            tangible happiness, might soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no trace but deep
            and everlasting regret.</p>
   <p>Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were received; and all wore
            a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that
            preyed there, and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although
            they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. A house was purchased for us
            near Cologny, by which we should enjoy the pleasures of the country, and yet be so near
            Geneva as to see my father every day; who would still reside within the walls, for the
            benefit of Ernest, that he might follow his studies at the schools.</p>
   <p>
      <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_114" n="110"/>In the mean time I took every precaution to
            defend my person, in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a
            dagger constantly about me, and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and by these
            means gained <add place="margin">I imagined</add> a greater degree of <del rend="strikethrough">tranquillity</del><add>security</add>. Indeed, as the period approached, the
            threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace,
            while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty,
            as the day fixed for its solemnization drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken of
            as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.</p>
   <p>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But
            on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_115" n="111"/>a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps
            also she thought of the dreadful secret, which I had promised to reveal to her the
            following day. My father was in the mean time overjoyed; and, in the bustle of
            preparation, only observed in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.</p>
   <p>After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my father’s; but it was
            agreed that Elizabeth and I should <del rend="strikethrough">pass the afternoon and night</del> at Evian<del rend="strikethrough">,</del><add>.</add> <del>and return to
            Cologny the next morning.</del> As the day was fair, and the wind favourable, we resolved to
            go by water.</p>
   <p>Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.
            We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind
            of canopy, while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_116" n="112"/>sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant
            banks of Montalêgre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blânc, and
            the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes
            coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the
            ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the
            invader who should wish to enslave it.</p>
  <p><add place="bottom_and_following_pages"><del rend="strikethrough">Why</del> Then gazing on the beloved face of Elizabeth on her graceful form and languid eyes, <del rend="strikethrough">of with</del> instead of feeling the exultation of a—lover—a husband—<del rend="strikethrough">in</del> a sudden gush of tears blinded my sight, &amp; as I turned away to hide the involuntary emotion fast drops fell<pb n="113"/> in the wave below. Reason again awoke, and shaking off all unmanly—or more properly all natural thoughts of mischance, I smiled as</add> I took the hand of Elizabeth: “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! if you knew what I have
            suffered, and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet, and
            freedom from despair, that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.”</p>
   <p>“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope, <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_117" n="113"/>nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a
            lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me
            not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us; but I will not listen
            to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along, and how the clouds which
            sometimes obscure, and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blânc, render this scene of
            beauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in
            the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a
            divine day! how happy and serene all nature appears!”</p>
   <p>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon
            melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her
            eyes, but it <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_118" n="114"/>continually gave place to distraction
            and reverie.</p>
   <p>The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance, and observed its path
            through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come
            closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its
            eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it, and the
            range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.</p>
   <p>The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sunk at sunset to
            a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water, and caused a pleasant motion among
            the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of
            flowers and hay. The sun sunk be<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_119" n="115"/>neath the horizon
            as we landed; and as I touched the shore, I felt those cares and fears revive, which
            soon were to clasp me, and cling to me for ever.</p>
