   <p>August 5th, 17—.</p>
   <p>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it <add place="margin">in writing</add>, although
          it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your
          possession.</p>
   <p>Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on
          all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea room in which she floated. Our situation was
          somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We
          accordingly lay to, hoping that some <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_034" n="022"/>change would
          take place in the atmosphere and weather.</p>
   <p>About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction,
          vast and irregular <add place="margin">mountains &amp; </add>plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades
          groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange
          sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own
          situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on
          towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man,
          but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the
          rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant
          inequalities of the ice.</p>
   <p>
      <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_035" n="023"/>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We
          were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to
          denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
          ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest
          attention. <add place="bottom">Are we then near land, and is this unknown wast inhabited by giants, of which the being we saw is a specimen? Such an idea is contrary to all experience, but if what we saw was an optical delusion, it was the most perfect and wonderful recorded in the history of nature.</add></p>
   <p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice
          broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in
          the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I
          profited of this time to rest for a few hours.</p>
   <p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and found all the
          sailors busy on one side <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_036" n="024"/>of the vessel, apparently
          talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before,
          which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog
          remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to
          enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
          some undiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here
          is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.”</p>
   <p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.
          “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me
          whither you are bound?”</p>
   <p>You may conceive my astonishment <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_037" n="025"/>on hearing such a
          question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have
          supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for
          the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a
          voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.</p>
   <p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God!
          Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would
          have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by
          fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry
          him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We
          accordingly <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_038" n="026"/>brought him back to the deck, and
          restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small
          quantity. As soon as he shewed signs of life, we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed
          him near the chimney of the kitchen-stove. By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little
          soup, which restored him wonderfully.</p>
   <p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often feared that his
          sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I
          removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never
          saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and
          even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act of kindness <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_039" n="027"/>towards him, or does him any the most trifling
          service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and
          sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and
          sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses
          him.</p>
   <p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished
          to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle
          curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire
          repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so
          strange a vehicle?</p>
   <p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_040" n="028"/>replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”</p>
   <p>“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs
          drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”</p>
   <p>This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning
          the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone
          with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these
          good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”</p>
   <p>“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any
          inquisitiveness of mine.”</p>
   <p>
      <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_041" n="029"/>“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous
          situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”</p>
   <p>Soon after this he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed
          the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the
          ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of
          safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.</p>
   <p>From this time the stranger seemed very eager to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge
          which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far
          too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. <del>But</del><add>And</add> I have promised that some one should watch for him, and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.</p>
   <p>
      <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_042" n="030"/>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange
          occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is
          very silent, and appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his
          manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him,
          although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to
          love him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and
          compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
          so attractive and amiable.</p>
   <p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide
          ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should
          have been <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_043" n="031"/>happy to have possessed as the brother of
          my heart.</p>
   <p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh
          incidents to record.</p>
