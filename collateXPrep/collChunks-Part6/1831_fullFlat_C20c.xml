  were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters
  that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of
  her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father, who understood French. She thanked
  him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent; and at the same time
  she gently deplored her own fate.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p6"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p7"/>“I have copies of these letters; for I found
  means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters
  were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart, I will give them to you, they will
  prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have
  time to repeat the substance of them to you.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p7"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p8"/>“Safie related, that her mother was a Christian
  Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of
  the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her
  mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her
  daughter in the tenets of her religion, and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect,
  and an independence of spirit, forbidden to the female followers of Mahomet. This lady died; but
  her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
  returning to Asia, and being immured within the walls of a haram, allowed only to occupy herself
  with infantile amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and
  a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian, and remaining in a country
  where women were allowed to take a rank in society, was enchanting to her.<p
    eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p8"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p9"/>“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed;
  but, on the night previous to it, he quitted his prison, and be<pb xml:id="F1831_v_123" n="107"
  />fore morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of
  his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided
  the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his
  daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p9"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p10"/>“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to
  Lyons, and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
  opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.<p
    eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p10"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p11"/>“Safie resolved to remain with her father until
  the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be
  united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the
  mean time he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and
  tenderest affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and
  sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native
    country.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p11"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p12"/>“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place,
  and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans.
  He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian; but he feared the
  resentment of Felix, if he should appear lukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power of
  his deliverer, if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited. He
  revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no
  longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans were
  facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p12"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p13"/>“The government of France were greatly enraged
  at the escape of their victim, and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of
  Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached
  Felix, and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father, and his gentle
  sister, lay in a noisome dungeon, while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her whom he
  loved. This idea was <pb xml:id="F1831_v_124" n="108"/>torture to him. He quickly arranged with
  the Turks, that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could
  return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the
  lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris, and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping
  to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p13"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p14"/>“He did not succeed. They remained confined for
  five months before the trial took place; the result of which deprived them of their fortune, and
  condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.<p
    eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p14"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p15"/>“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in
  Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and
  his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced
  to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour, and had quitted Italy with his
  daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money, to aid him, as he said, in some plan of
  future maintenance.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p15"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p16"/>“Such were the events that preyed on the heart
  of Felix, and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could have
  endured poverty; and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it: but
  the ingratitude of the Turk, and the loss of his beloved Safie, were misfortunes more bitter and
  irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.<p
    eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p16"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p17"/>“When the news reached Leghorn, that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her
  lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous nature of Safie was outraged
  by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily,
  reiterating his tyrannical mandate.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p17"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p18"/>“A few days after, the Turk entered his
  daughter’s apartment, and told her hastily, that he had reason to believe that his residence at
  Leghorn had been divulged, and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government;
  he had, consequently hired a vessel to convey <pb xml:id="F1831_v_125" n="109"/>him to
  Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He intended to leave his daughter
  under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his
  property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p18"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p19"/>“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the
  plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey was
  abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike adverse to it. By some papers of her
  father, which fell into her hands, she heard of the exile of her lover, and learnt the name of the
  spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination.
  Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her, and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an
  attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for
    Germany.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p19"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div14_p20"/>“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty
  leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her
  with the most devoted affection; but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone,
  unacquainted with the language of the country, and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.
  She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they
  were bound; and, after her death, the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that
  Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.<p
