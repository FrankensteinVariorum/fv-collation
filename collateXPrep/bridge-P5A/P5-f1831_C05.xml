            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_div4_p3">Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the <seg xml:id="C05_app7-f1831_end"/>

            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_div4_p4">About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular <seg xml:id="C05_app13-f1831_end"/>

               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app15-f1831_start"/>of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the <seg xml:id="C05_app15-f1831_end"/>
               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app16-f1831_start"/>ice.</p>

               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app17-f1831_start"/>appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest <seg xml:id="C05_app17-f1831_end"/>
               <seg xml:id="C05_app18-f1831_start"/>attention.</p>

               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app19-f1831_start"/>two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to <seg xml:id="C05_app19-f1831_end"/>

            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_div4_p7">In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and found all the sailors busy on one side <seg xml:id="C05_app21-f1831_end"/>
               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app22-f1831_start"/>of <seg xml:id="C05_app22-f1831_end"/>

               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app24-f1831_start"/>vessel, apparently talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.”</p>
            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_div4_p8">On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”</p>
            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_div4_p9">You may conceive my astonishment <seg xml:id="C05_app24-f1831_end"/>

               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app26-f1831_start"/>hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.</p>
            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_div4_p10">Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We accordingly <seg xml:id="C05_app26-f1831_end"/>

               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app33-f1831_start"/>we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the <seg xml:id="C05_app33-f1831_end"/>

When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act of kindness <seg xml:id="C05_app37-f1831_end"/>
               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app38-f1831_start"/>towards <seg xml:id="C05_app38-f1831_end"/>

But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>
            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_div4_p12">When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?</p>
            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_div4_p13">His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he <seg xml:id="C05_app41-f1831_end"/>

            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_div4_p17">This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he <seg xml:id="C05_app45-f1831_end"/>
               <seg xml:id="C05_app46-f1831_start"/>said,—“I <seg xml:id="C05_app46-f1831_end"/>
