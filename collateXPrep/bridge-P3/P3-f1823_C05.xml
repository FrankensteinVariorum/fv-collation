         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p37" ana="Start"/>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I

         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p38" ana="Start"/>Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded
            by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the <seg xml:id="C05_app9-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app10-f1823_start"/>sea room <seg xml:id="C05_app10-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app11-f1823_start"/>in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as
            we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some
            change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p38" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p39" ana="Start"/>About two
            o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and
            irregular <seg xml:id="C05_app11-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app12-f1823_start"/>plains <seg xml:id="C05_app12-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app13-f1823_start"/>of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my
            own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
            attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We
            perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the
            north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man, but
            apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the
            rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant
            inequalities of the ice.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p39" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p40" ana="Start"/>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We
            were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to
            denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
            ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest <seg xml:id="C05_app13-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app14-f1823_start"/>attention.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p40" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p41" ana="Start"/>About <seg xml:id="C05_app14-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app15-f1823_start"/>two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night
            the ice broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to
            encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up
            of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p41" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p42" ana="Start"/>In the
            morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and found all the sailors
            busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to some one in the sea. It was, in
            fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night,
            on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being
            within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the
            other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an
            European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here is our captain, and he will
            not allow you to perish on the open sea.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p42" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p43" ana="Start"/>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in
            English, although with a foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,
            “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p43" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p44" ana="Start"/>You may
            conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the
            brink of destruction, and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been
            a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can
            afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern
            pole.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p44" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p45" ana="Start"/>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and
            consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus
            capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were
            nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a
            man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin; but as soon as
            he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck,
            and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a
            small quantity. As soon as he <seg xml:id="C05_app15-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app16-f1823_start"/>showed <seg xml:id="C05_app16-f1823_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app17-f1823_start"/>signs of <seg xml:id="C05_app17-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app18-f1823_start"/>life <seg xml:id="C05_app18-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app19-f1823_start"/>we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the <seg xml:id="C05_app19-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app20-f1823_start"/>kitchen-stove. <seg xml:id="C05_app20-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app21-f1823_start"/>By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him
            wonderfully.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p45" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p46" ana="Start"/>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to
            speak; and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he
            had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as
            much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have
            generally an expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are moments when, if
            any one performs an act of kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling
            service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and
            sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and
            sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses
            him.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p46" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p47" ana="Start"/>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great
            trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not
            allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose
            restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked,
            Why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?<p loc="novel1_letter4_p47" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p48" ana="Start"/>His
            countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he replied, “To seek
            one who fled from me.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p48" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p49" ana="Start"/>“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same
            fashion?”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p49" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p50" ana="Start"/>“Yes.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p50" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p51" ana="Start"/>“Then I fancy we have seen him; <seg xml:id="C05_app21-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app22-f1823_start"/>for, <seg xml:id="C05_app22-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app23-f1823_start"/>the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a
            man in it, across the ice.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p51" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p52" ana="Start"/>This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked
            a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had
            pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he <seg xml:id="C05_app23-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app24-f1823_start"/>said, “I <seg xml:id="C05_app24-f1823_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app25-f1823_start"/>have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good
            people; but you are too considerate to make <seg xml:id="C05_app25-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app26-f1823_start"/>inquiries.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p52" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p53" ana="Start"/>“Certainly; <seg xml:id="C05_app26-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app27-f1823_start"/>it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with
            any inquisitiveness of mine.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p53" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p54" ana="Start"/>“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous
            situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p54" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p55" ana="Start"/>Soon after
            this he <seg xml:id="C05_app27-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app28-f1823_start"/>inquired <seg xml:id="C05_app28-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app29-f1823_start"/>if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other
            sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the ice had
            not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of
            safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p55" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p56" ana="Start"/>From this
            time <seg xml:id="C05_app29-f1823_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C05_app31-f1823_start"/>the <seg xml:id="C05_app31-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app32-f1823_start"/>stranger seemed very eager <seg xml:id="C05_app32-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app33-f1823_start"/>to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I
            have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness
            of the atmosphere. <seg xml:id="C05_app33-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app34-f1823_start"/>But <seg xml:id="C05_app34-f1823_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C05_app35-f1823_start"/>I have promised that some one should watch for him, and give him instant
            notice if any new object should appear in sight.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p56" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p57" ana="Start"/>Such is my
            journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger
            has gradually improved in health, but is very silent, and appears uneasy when any one
            except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the
            sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with
            him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief
            fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better
            days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p57" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p58" ana="Start"/>I said in
            one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet
            I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been
            happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p58" ana="End"/>
         <p loc="novel1_letter4_p59" ana="Start"/>I shall
            continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh
            incidents to record.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p59" ana="End"/>
