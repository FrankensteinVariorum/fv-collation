            by a countryman as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a
            thick black veil. Agatha asked a question; to which the stranger only replied by
            pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical, but unlike
            that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady;
            who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty
            and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
            dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her
            complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.&lt;p

            degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes
            sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as
            beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few
            tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously,
            and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to
            understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, <seg xml:id="C19_app13-#fThomas_end"/>

            comprehend; but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage,
            dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly
            happy, and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha,
            kissed the hands of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which
            appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed
            thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not

            retired early. When they separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said,
            ‘Good night, sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by
            the frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the
            subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every

            that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice
            flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods.&lt;p

            accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old
