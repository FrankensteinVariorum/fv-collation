    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p1"/>O<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p1_hi1"/>N<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p1_hi1"/> my return, I found the following letter from my
    father:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p1"/>
    <del sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_del1"/>
    <ab sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_del1_ab1"/>
    <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_del1_ab1_hi1"/>”To<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_del1_ab1_hi1"/> V.

    <del eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_del1"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2"/>“<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2_hi1"/>MY DEAR VICTOR<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2_hi1"/>,<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p3"/>“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to
    us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on
    which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.
    What would be your surprise, my son, when <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_147" n="135"/>you
    expected a happy and gay welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?
    And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous
    to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on an absent child? I wish to
    prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims
    over the page, to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p3"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p4"/>“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was
    so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p4"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p5"/>“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the
    transaction.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p5"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p6"/>“Last Thursday (May 7th) I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in
    Plainpalais. The evening was <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_148" n="136"/>warm and serene, and
    we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of
    returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were
    not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently
    Ernest came, and inquired if we had seen his brother: he said, that they had been
    playing together, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought
    for him, and afterwards waited for him a long time, but that he did not return.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p6"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p7"/>“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell,
    when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there.
    We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_149" n="137"/>boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the
    damps and dews of night: Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the
    morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active
    in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer’s
    finger was on his neck.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p7"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p8"/>“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the
    secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to
    prevent her; but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the
    neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my
    darling infant!’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p8"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9"/>“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was
    only to weep and sigh. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_150" n="138"/>She told me, that that same
    evening William had <del sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9_del1"/>teazed<del eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9_del1"/>
    <add sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9_add1"/>entreated<add eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9_add1"/> her to let him wear a <del sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9_del2"/>very valuable<del eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9_del2"/> miniature that she
    possessed of your mother. <add sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9_add2"/>Which was set in jewels. <add eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9_add2"/>This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which
    urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our
    exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved
    William.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p10"/>“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and
    accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are
    all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be
    our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to
    witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p10"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p11"/>“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_151" n="139"/>of vengeance
    against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead
    of festering the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with
    kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p11"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p12"/>“Your affectionate and afflicted father,<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p12"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13"/>A<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13_hi1"/>LPHONSE<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13_hi1"/> F<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13_hi2"/>RANKENSTEIN<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13_hi2"/>.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p14"/>“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p14"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p15"/>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe
    the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my
    friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p15"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p16"/>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness,
    “are you always to be <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_152" n="140"/>unhappy? My dear friend,
    what has happened?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p16"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p17"/>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the
    extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account
    of my misfortune.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p17"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p18"/>“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable.
    What do you intend to do?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p18"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p19"/>“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p19"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p20"/>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to raise my spirits. He did not do this by common
    topics of consolation, but by exhibiting the truest sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,
    “that dear child; he now sleeps with his angel mother. His friends mourn and weep, but
    he is at rest: he does not <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_153" n="141"/>now feel the murderer’s
    grasp; a sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a fit
    subject for pity;</xml>
