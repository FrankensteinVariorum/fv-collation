          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p1"/>I <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p1_hi1"/>WAS<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p1_hi1"/> soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an
            old benevolent man, with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some
            degree of severity; and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as
            witnesses on this occasion.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p1"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p2"/>About half a dozen men came forward; and one being selected by the magistrate, he
            deposed, that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law,
            Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock, they observed <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_069" n="065"/>a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It
            was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour,
            but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He walked on first,
            carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance.
            As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something, and fell all
            his length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him; and, by the light of
            their lantern, they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all
            appearance dead. Their first supposition was, that it was the corpse of some person who
            had been drowned, and was thrown on shore by the waves; but, upon examination, they
            found that the clothes were not wet, and even that <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_070" n="066"/>the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman
            near the spot, and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. He appeared to be a
            handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been
            strangled; for there was no sign of any violence, except the black mark of fingers on
            his neck.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p2"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p3"/>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me; but when the mark
            of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of my brother, and felt myself
            extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to
            lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye, and of course
            drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p3"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p4"/>The son confirmed his father’s ac<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_071" n="067"/>count: but when
            Daniel Nugent was called, he swore positively that, just before the fall of his
            companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
            and, as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which
            I had just landed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p4"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p5"/>A woman deposed, that she lived near the beach, and was standing at the door of her
            cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the
            discovery of the body, when she saw a boat, with only one man in it, push off from that
            part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p5"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p6"/>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her
            house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed, and rubbed it; and Daniel went to the 
            <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_072" n="068"/>town for an apothecary, but life was quite
            gone.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p6"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p7"/>Several other men were examined concerning my landing; and they agreed, that, with the
            strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had
            beaten about for many hours, and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from
            which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the
            body from another place, and it was likely, that as I did not appear to know the shore,
            I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the
            place where I had deposited the corpse.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p7"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p8"/>Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room
            where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_073" n="069"/>what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably
            suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been
            described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to
            the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place
            during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons
            in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was
            perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p8"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p9"/>I entered the room where the corpse lay, and was led up to the coffin. How can I
            describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I
            reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony, <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_074" n="070"/>that faintly reminds me of the anguish of recognition. The trial, the
            presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory, when I saw
            the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath; and,
            throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you
            also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their
            destiny: but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor—”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p9"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p10"/>The human frame could no longer support the agonizing suffering that I endured, and I
            was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p10"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p11"/>A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death: my ravings, as I
            afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_075" n="071"/>of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my
            attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and, at
            others, I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud
            with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone
            understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other
            witnesses.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p11"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p12"/>Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into
            forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of
            their doating parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the
            bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of
            what materials was <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_076" n="072"/>I made, that I could thus
            resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the
            torture.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p12"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p13"/>But I was doomed to live; and, in two months, found myself as awaking from a dream, in
            a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all
            the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to
            understanding: I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened, and only felt as if
            some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around, and saw the
            barred windows, and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my
            memory, and I groaned bitterly.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p13"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p14"/>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_077" n="073"/>She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the
            turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterixe
            that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to
            see without sympathizing in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire
            indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had
            heard during my sufferings:<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p14"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p15"/>“Are you better now, Sir?” said she.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p15"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p16"/>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all
            true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery
            and horror.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p16"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p17"/>“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the gentleman you
            murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_078" n="074"/>for I fancy it will go hard with you; but you will
            be hung when the next sessions come on. However, that’s none of my business, I am sent
            to nurse you, and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience, it were well if
            every body did the same.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p17"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p18"/>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person
            just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid, and unable to reflect on all
            that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes
            doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the
            force of reality.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p18"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p19"/>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness
            pressed around me: no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no
            dear hand sup<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_079" n="075"/>ported me. The physician came and
            prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was
            visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage
            of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman who
            would gain his fee?<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p19"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p20"/>These were my first reflections; but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shewn me
            extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me
            (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse.
            It is true, he seldom came to see me; for, although he ardently desired to relieve the
            sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
            miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, some<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_080" n="076"/>times to see that I was not neglected; but his visits were short, and at
            long intervals.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p20"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p21"/>One day, when I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open,
            and my cheeks livid like those in death, I was overcome by gloom and misery, and often
            reflected I had better seek death than remain miserably pent up only to be let loose in
            a world replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare
            myself guilty, and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had
            been. Such were my thoughts, when the door of my apartment was opened, and Mr. Kirwin
            entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to
            mine, and addressed me in French—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p21"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p22"/>“I fear that this place is very shock<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_081" n="077"/>ing to you;
            can I do any thing to make you more comfortable?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p22"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p23"/>“I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on the whole earth there is no
            comfort which I am capable of receiving.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p23"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p24"/>“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down
            as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy
            abode; for, doubtless, evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal
            charge.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p24"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p25"/>“That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events, become the most
            miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any
            evil to me?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p25"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p26"/>“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that
            have lately occur<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_082" n="078"/>red. You were thrown, by some
            surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality; seized immediately,
            and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of
            your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner, and placed, as it were, by some
            fiend across your path.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p26"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p27"/>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of
            my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess
            concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance; for Mr.
            Kirwin hastened to say—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p27"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p28"/>“It was not until a day or two after your illness that I thought of examining your
            dress, that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an
            account of your misfortune <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_083" n="079"/>and illness. I found
            several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be
            from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva: nearly two months have elapsed since the
            departure of my letter.—But you are ill; even now you tremble: you are unfit for
            agitation of any kind.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p28"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p29"/>“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event: tell me what new
            scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p29"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p30"/>“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin, with gentleness; “and some one, a
            friend, is come to visit you.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p30"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p31"/>I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted
            into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery, and taunt me with the
            death of Clerval, as <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_084" n="080"/>a new incitement for me to
            comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in
            agony—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p31"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p32"/>“Oh! take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not let him enter!”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p32"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p33"/>Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding my
            exclamation as a presumption of my guilt, and said, in rather a severe tone—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p33"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p34"/>“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been
            welcome, instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p34"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p35"/>“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to
            pleasure. “Is my father, indeed, come? How kind, how very kind. But where is he, why
            does he not hasten to me?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p35"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p36"/>My change of manner surprised and <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_085" n="081"/>pleased the
            magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of
            delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose, and quitted the
            room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p36"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p37"/>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my
            father. I stretched out my hand to him, and cried—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p37"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p38"/>“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p38"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p39"/>My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare, and endeavoured, by dwelling on
            these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon
            felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you
            inhabit, my son!” said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows, and wretched <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_086" n="082"/>appearance of the room. “You travelled to seek
            happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p39"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p40"/>The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured
            in my weak state; I shed tears.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p40"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p41"/>“Alas! yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over
            me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of
            Henry.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p41"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p42"/>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my
            health rendered every precaution necessary that could insure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin
            came in, and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But
            the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually
            recovered my health.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p42"/>

      <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_087" n="083"/>As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a
            gloomy and black melancholy, that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was for
            ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which these
            reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! why did they
            preserve so miserable and detested a life? It was surely that I might fulfil my
            destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish
            these throbbings, and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the
            dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then the
            appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and
            I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that
            might <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_088" n="084"/>bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p43"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p44"/>The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in prison; and
            although I was still weak, and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel
            nearly a hundred miles to the county-town, where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged
            himself with every care of collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence. I was spared
            the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the
            court that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being
            proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found, and
            a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p44"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p45"/>My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a cri<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_089" n="085"/>minal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe
            the fresh atmosphere, and allowed to return to my native country. I did not participate
            in these feelings; for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The
            cup of life was poisoned for ever; and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy
            and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated
            by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes they were the
            expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the
            lids, and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery clouded
            eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p45"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p46"/>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_090" n="086"/>Geneva, which I should soon visit—of Elizabeth, and
            Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish
            for happiness; and thought, with melancholy delight, of my beloved cousin; or longed,
            with a devouring <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p46_hi1"/>maladie du pays<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p46_hi1"/>, to see once more the blue lake
            and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood: but my general state of
            feeling was a torpor, in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene
            in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted, but by paroxysms of anguish and
            despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed;
            and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some
            dreadful act of violence.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p46"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p47"/>I remember, as I quitted the prison, <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_091" n="087"/>I heard one
            of the men say, “He may be innocent of the murder, but he has certainly a bad
            conscience.” These words struck me. A bad conscience! yes, surely I had one. William,
            Justine, and Clerval, had died through my infernal machinations; “And whose death,”
            cried I, “is to finish the tragedy? Ah! my father, do not remain in this wretched
            country; take me where I may forget myself, my existence, and all the world.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p47"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p48"/>My father easily acceded to my desire; and, after having taken leave of Mr. Kirwin, we
            hastened to Dublin. I felt as if I was relieved from a heavy weight, when the packet
            sailed with a fair wind from Ireland, and I had quitted for ever the country which had
            been to me the scene of so much misery.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p48"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p49"/>It was midnight. My father slept in <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_092" n="088"/>the cabin;
            and I lay on the deck, looking at the stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves.
            I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish
            joy, when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the
            light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from
            the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
            that I was deceived by no vision, and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had
            fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole
            life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my
            mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered shuddering at the mad enthusiasm
            that hurried me on to the crea<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_093" n="089"/>tion of my hideous
            enemy, and I called to mind the night during which he first lived. I was unable to
            pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept
            bitterly.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p49"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p50"/>Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every night a
            small quantity of laudanum; for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to
            gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of
            my various misfortunes, I now took a double dose, and soon slept profoundly. But sleep
            did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand
            objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of night-mare; I felt
            the fiend’s grasp in my neck, and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rung
            in my ears. My father, who was <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_094" n="090"/>watching over me,
            perceiving my restlessness, awoke me, and pointed to the port of Holyhead, which we were
            now entering.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div22_p50"/>
