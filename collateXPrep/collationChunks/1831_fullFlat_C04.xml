          advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward
          voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for
          many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold, and apparently firm of
          purpose; nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the
          dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have
          already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so
          warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which
          I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not
          expected.<p eID="novel1_letter3_div3_p3"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter3_div3_p4"/>No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One or two
          stiff gales, and the springing of a leak, are accidents which experienced navigators
          scarcely remember to record; and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us
          during our voyage.<p eID="novel1_letter3_div3_p4"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter3_div3_p5"/>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not
          rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.<p eID="novel1_letter3_div3_p5"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter3_div3_p6"/>But success <hi sID="novel1_letter3_div3_p6_hi1"/>shall<hi eID="novel1_letter3_div3_p6_hi1"/> crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I
          have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas: the very stars themselves being
          witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still proceed over the untamed yet
          obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?<p eID="novel1_letter3_div3_p6"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter3_div3_p7"/>My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish. Heaven bless my
          beloved sister!<p eID="novel1_letter3_div3_p7"/>
