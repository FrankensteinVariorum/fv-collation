   <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
   <p> W<hi rend="smallcaps">HEN</hi> I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents
            resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto
            attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion
            of my education, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my
            native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day
            resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it
            were, of my future misery. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_074" n="062"/>Elizabeth had caught
            the scarlet fever; but her illness was not severe, and she quickly recovered. During her
            confinement, many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from
            attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard
            that her favourite was recovering, she could no longer debar herself from her society,
            and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was past. The consequences
            of this imprudence were fatal. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was very
            malignant, and the looks of her attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her
            death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this <del>admirable</del><add>amiable</add> woman did not desert her. She
            joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself: “My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of
            future <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_075" n="063"/>happiness were placed on the prospect of
            your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my
            love, you must supply my place to your younger cousins. Alas! I regret that I am taken
            from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But
            these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
            death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”</p>
   <p>She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not
            describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable
            evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on
            the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw
            every day, and whose very existence <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_076" n="064"/>appeared a
            part of our own, can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can
            have been extinguished, and the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can
            be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when
            the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief
            commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connexion; and why
            should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length
            arrives, when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays
            upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was
            dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course
            with the rest, and learn to think <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_077" n="065"/>ourselves
            fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.</p>
   <p>My journey to Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again
            determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. This period was
            spent sadly; my mother’s death, and my speedy departure, depressed our spirits; but
            Elizabeth endeavoured to renew the spirit of cheerfulness in our little society. Since
            the death of her aunt, her mind had acquired new firmness and vigour. She determined to
            fulfil her duties with the greatest exactness; and she felt that that most imperious
            duty, of rendering her uncle and cousins happy, had devolved upon her. She consoled me,
            amused her uncle, instructed my brothers; and I never beheld her so enchanting as at
            this time, when she was continually endeavouring to con<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_078" n="066"/>tribute to the happiness of others, entirely forgetful of herself.</p>
   <p>The day of my departure at length arrived. I had taken leave of all my friends,
            excepting Clerval, who spent the last evening with us. He bitterly lamented that he was
            unable to accompany me: but his father could not be persuaded to part with him,
            intending that he should become a partner with him in business, in compliance with his
            favourite theory, that learning was superfluous in the commerce of ordinary life. Henry
            <del>had a refined mind; he had no desire to be idle, and was well pleased to become his
            father’s partner, but he believed that a man might be a very good trader, and yet
            possess a cultivated understanding.</del><add>loved poetry and his mind was filled with the imagery and sublime sentiments of the masters of that art. A poet himself, he turned with <del>y</del> disgust from the details of ordinary life. His own <del>soul</del> mind was all the possession that he prized, beautiful &amp; majestic thoughts the only wealth he coveted—daring as the eagle and as free, common laws could not be applied to him; and while you gazed on him you felt his soul’s spark was more divine—more truly stolen from Apollo’s sacred fire, than the glimmering ember that animates other men.</add></p>
   <p>We sat late, listening to his complaints, and making many little arrangements for the
            future. The next <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_079" n="067"/>morning early I departed. Tears
            gushed from the eyes of Elizabeth; they proceeded partly from sorrow at my departure,
            and partly because she reflected that the same journey was to have taken place three
            months before, when a mother’s blessing would have accompanied me.</p>
   <p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in the most
            melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions,
            continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure, I was now alone. In the
            university, whither I was going, I must form my own friends, and be my own protector. My
            life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic; and this had given me
            invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval;
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_080" n="068"/>these were “old familiar faces;” but I believed
            myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I
            commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired
            the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain
            during my youth cooped up in one place, and had longed to enter the world, and take my
            station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would,
            indeed, have been folly to repent.</p>
   <p>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to
            Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town
            met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted to my solitary apartment, to spend the
            evening as I pleased.</p>
   <p>
      <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_081" n="069"/>The next morning I delivered my letters of
            introduction, and paid a visit to some of the principal professors, and among others to
            M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He received me with politeness, and asked me
            several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science
            appertaining to natural philosophy. I mentioned, it is true, with fear and trembling,
            the only authors I had ever read upon those subjects. The professor stared: “Have you,”
            he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”</p>
   <p>I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every
            instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have
            burdened your memory with exploded systems, and useless names. Good God! in what <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_082" n="070"/>desert land have you lived, where no one was kind
            enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have so greedily imbibed, are a
            thousand years old, and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected in this
            enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My
            dear Sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”</p>
   <p>So saying, he stept aside, and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural
            philosophy, which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me, after mentioning that in
            the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon
            natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow-professor,
            would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he missed.</p>
   <p>I returned home, not disappointed, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_083" n="071"/>for I had long
            considered those authors useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but I
            did not feel much inclined to study the books which I procured at his recommendation. M.
            Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and repulsive countenance; the
            teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his doctrine. Besides, I had a
            contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different, when the
            masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were
            grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
            itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly
            founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of
            little worth.</p>
   <p>Such were my reflections during the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_084" n="072"/>first two or
            three days spent almost in solitude. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the
            information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could
            not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a
            pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had
            hitherto been out of town.</p>
   <p>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which
            M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He
            appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
            benevolence; a few gray hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head
            were nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_085" n="073"/>voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his
            lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements
            made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most
            distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the
            science, and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory
            experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I
            shall never forget:—</p>
   <p>“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and
            performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot
            be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose
            hands seem only made to dabble <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_086" n="074"/>in dirt, and their
            eyes to pour over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They
            penetrate into the recesses of nature, and shew how she works in her hiding places. They
            ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature
            of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can
            command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world
            with its own shadows.”</p>
   <p>I departed highly pleased with the professor and his lecture, and paid him a visit the
            same evening. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public;
            for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture, which in his own house
            was replaced by the greatest <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_087" n="075"/>affability and
            kindness. He heard with attention my little narration concerning my studies, and smiled
            at the names of Cornelius Agrippa, and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M.
            Krempe had exhibited. He said, that “these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern
            philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left
            to us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in connected classifications, the
            facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The
            labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately
            turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I listened <del rend="strikethrough">to his statement, which was
            delivered</del><add>to him with interest for he spoke</add> without <del rend="strikethrough">any</del> presumption or affectation; and then added, that his lecture had
            removed my prejudices against modern <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_088" n="076"/>chemists; and
            I, at the same time, requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.</p>
   <p>“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application
            equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of
            natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is
            on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not
            neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist, if
            he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become
            really a man of science, and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to
            apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”</p>
   <p>
      <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_089" n="077"/>He then took me into his laboratory, and
            explained to me the uses of his various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to
            procure, and promising me the use of his own, when I should have advanced far enough in
            the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I
            had requested; and I took my leave.</p>
  <p>Thus ended a day memorable to me: it decided my future destiny.</p><note resp="#MWS">If there were ever to be another edition of this book, I should re-write these two first chapters. The incidents are tame and ill-arranged—the language sometimes childish.—They are unworthy of the rest of the <del>w book</del>narration.</note>
