    I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general; but I
    united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval
    was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved
    enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of
    chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of
    enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into
    masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the
    Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the
    holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p3"/>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were
    possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the
    tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all
    the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly
    discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement
    of filial love.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p3"/>
