    we were strangers to any species of disunion
    or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast
    that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and
    more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
    application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied
    herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and
    wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains;
    the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and
    turbulence of our Alpine summers,—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
    While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent
    appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a
    secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws
    of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest
    sensations I can remember.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/>
