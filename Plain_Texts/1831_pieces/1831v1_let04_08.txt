August 19, 17--.

Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily perceive, Captain
Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had
determined, at one time, that the memory of these evils should die with
me; but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did;
and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a
serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of
my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are
pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have
rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my
tale; one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking, and
console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed
marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature, I might fear to
encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will
appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions, which would provoke
the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature: --
nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence
of the truth of the events of which
it is composed."

You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered
communication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a
recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the
promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong
desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these 
feelings in my answer.
