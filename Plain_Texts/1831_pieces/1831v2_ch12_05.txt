"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I
discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read, as when
he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for
speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these
also; but how was that possible, when I did not even understand the sounds
for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this
science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation,
although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I easily perceived
that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I
ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their
language; which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the
deformity of my figure; for with this also the contrast perpetually
presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.

"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers -- their grace, beauty,
and delicate complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in
a transparent pool! At first I
started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in
the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I
am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and
mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this
miserable deformity.

"As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished,
and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was
more employed; and the heart-moving indications of impending famine
disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was
wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of
plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort
increased daily as the season advanced.
