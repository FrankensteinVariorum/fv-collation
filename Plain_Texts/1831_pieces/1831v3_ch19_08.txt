In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first
arrived; but, as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day
more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on
myself to enter my laboratory for several days; and at other
times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work. It was,
indeed, a filthy process in
which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded
me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on
the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of
my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart
often sickened at the work of my hands.

Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where
nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual
scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous.
Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with
my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them, lest they
should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I
feared to wander from the sight of my fellow-creatures, lest when
alone he should come to claim his companion.

In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already
considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion with a
tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to
question, but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of
evil, that made my heart sicken in my bosom.
