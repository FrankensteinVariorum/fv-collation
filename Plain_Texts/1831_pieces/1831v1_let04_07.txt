"I agree with you," replied the stranger; "we are unfashioned creatures,
but half made up, if one wiser, 
better, dearer than ourselves -- such a friend ought to be -- do not lend 
his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of 
human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting 
friendship.  You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause 
for despair. But I -- I have lost every thing, and cannot begin life anew."

As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm
settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent,
and presently retired to his cabin.

Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does
the beauties of nature. The starry
sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems
still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a
double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by
disappointments; yet, when he has retired
into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo
around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.

Will you smile at the enthusiasm I
express concerning this divine
wanderer? You would not, if you saw him. You have been tutored and
refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are, therefore,
somewhat fastidious; but this only 
renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful 
man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he 
possesses, that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I 
ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment; a quick but 
neverfailing power of judgment; a penetration into the causes of things, 
unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of 
expression, and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.
