You may conceive my astonishment on hearing
such a question
addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to
whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a
resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious
wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on
a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.

Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to
come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who
thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been
boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully
emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so
wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin;
but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We
accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to
animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow
a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life, we wrapped
him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the
kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little
soup, which restored him wonderfully.

Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often
feared that his suffering had deprived him of understanding. When he had
in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty
would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have
generally an expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are moments when, if
any one performs an act of kindness towards him, or does him any the most
trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a
beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is
generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of
the weight of woes that oppresses him.
