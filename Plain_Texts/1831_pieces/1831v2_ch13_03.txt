"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they
separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, 'Good night,
sweet Safie.' He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by
the frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest
was the subject of their conversation. I
ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards
that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.

"The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual
occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the
old man, and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly
beautiful, that they at once drew tears
of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in
a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the
woods.

"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first
declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in
sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man
appeared enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured to
explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she
bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.

"The days now passed as peacefully as before, with the sole alteration,
that joy had taken the place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
Safie was always gay and happy; she and
I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months
I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.
