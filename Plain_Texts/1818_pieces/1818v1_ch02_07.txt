I departed highly pleased with the professor and his lecture, and paid him
a visit the same evening.  His manners in private were even more mild and
attractive than in public; for there was a certain dignity in his mien
during his lecture, which in his own house was replaced by the greatest
affability and kindness. He heard with attention my little narration
concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt
that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said, that "these were men to whose
indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the
foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to
give new names, arrange in connected
classifications, the facts which they in a great degree had been the
instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however
erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the
solid advantage of mankind." I listened to his statement, which was
delivered without any presumption or affectation; and then added, that his
lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; and I, at the
same time, requested his advice concerning the books I ought to
procure.

"I am happy," said M. Waldman, "to have gained a disciple; and if your
application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural
philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be
made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at
the same time I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man
would make but a very sorry chemist, if he attended to that department of
human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science,
and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to
every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics."
