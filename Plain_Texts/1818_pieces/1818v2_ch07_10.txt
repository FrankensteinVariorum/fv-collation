"'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness
directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present
humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point
of meeting.'

"'May I know the names and residence of those friends?'

"I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which
was to rob me of, or bestow happiness on me forever. I struggled
vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort
destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair, and
sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger
protectors. I had not a moment to lose; but, seizing the hand of
the old man, I cried, 'Now is the time! -- save and protect me!
You and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you
desert me in the hour of trial!'

"'Great God!' exclaimed the old man, 'who are you?'

"At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha
entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?
Agatha fainted; and Safie, unable to
attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward,
and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I
clung: in a transport of fury, he
dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have
torn him limb from limb, as a lion rends the antelope. But my heart sunk
within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point
of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the
cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.
