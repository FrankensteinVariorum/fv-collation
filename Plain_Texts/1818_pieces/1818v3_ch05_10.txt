"Be happy, my dear Victor," replied Elizabeth; "there is, I
hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively
joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something
whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is
opened before us; but I will not listen to such a sinister voice.
Observe how fast we move along, and how the clouds which
sometimes obscure, and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont
Blânc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting. Look
also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear
waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the
bottom. What a divine day! how
happy and serene all nature appears!"

Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine
from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was
fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it
continually gave place to distraction and reverie.

The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance, and observed its path
through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the lower
hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached
the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.
The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it, and
the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.

The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing
rapidity, sunk at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just
ruffled the water, and caused a pleasant motion among the trees
as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most
delightful scent of flowers and
hay. The sun sunk beneath the horizon as we landed; and as I
touched the shore, I felt those cares and fears revive, which
soon were to clasp me, and cling to me for ever.
