The trial began; and after the advocate against her had stated the charge,
several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her,
which might have staggered any one who had not such proof of her innocence as I had.
She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been
committed, and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not
far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards
found. The woman asked her what she did there; but she looked very
strangely, and only returned a confused
and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o'clock; and when one inquired
where she had passed the night, she replied, that she had been looking for
the child, and demanded earnestly, if any thing had been heard concerning
him. When shewn the body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her
bed for several days. The picture was then produced, which the servant had
found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that
it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had
placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the
court.

Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had
proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and
misery, were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her
tears; but when she was desired to plead, she collected her
powers, and spoke in an audible although variable voice:--

"God knows," she said, "how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend
that my protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the
facts which have been adduced against me; and I hope the character I
have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation,
where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious."
