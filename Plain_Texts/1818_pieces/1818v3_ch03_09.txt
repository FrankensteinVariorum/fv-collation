Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense
I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed
like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.

How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that
clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery! I
constructed another sail with a part of my dress, and eagerly
steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky
appearance; but, as I approached nearer, I easily perceived the
traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore, and found
myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of
civilized man. I eagerly traced the windings of the land, and
hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a
small promontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I
resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place where I
could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money
with me. As I turned the promontory, I perceived a small neat
town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my
unexpected escape.

As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
people crowded towards the spot. They seemed very much surprised at my
appearance; but, instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together
with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight
sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English;
and I therefore addressed them in that
language:  "My good friends," said I, "will you be so kind as to tell
me the name of this town, and inform me where I am?"

"You will know that soon enough," replied a man with a gruff
voice. "May be you are come to a place that will not prove much
to your taste; but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I
promise you."
