This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly
quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my
opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stage-coach. The cold
is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs, a dress which I have already
adopted; for there is a great difference between walking the deck and
remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood
from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life
on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks;
and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be
done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many
sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to
the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June: and when shall I return?
Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed,
many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may
meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down
blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my
gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Wᴀʟᴛᴏɴ.
