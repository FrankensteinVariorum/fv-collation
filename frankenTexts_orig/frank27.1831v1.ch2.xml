            <item>
               <p>We were brought up together; there was not quite a
              year difference in our ages. I need not say that we
              were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.
              Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and
              the
              diversity and contrast that subsisted in our
              characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of
              a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but,
              with
              all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
              application, and was more deeply smitten with the
              thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with
              following the aerial creations
              of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous
              scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the
              sublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of the
              season; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and
              the life and turbulence of our Alpine
              summers,—she found ample scope for admiration
              and delight. While my companion contemplated with a
              serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent
              appearances of things, I delighted in investigating
              their causes. The world was to me a secret which
              I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to
              learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to
              rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the
              earliest sensations I can remember.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>On the birth of
              a
              second son, my junior by seven years, my parents
              gave up entirely their wandering life, and fixed
              themselves in their native country. We possessed a
              house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive,
              the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of
              rather more than a
              league from the city. We resided principally in
              the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed
              in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid
              a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few. I
              was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in
              general; but I united myself in the bonds of the
              closest friendship to one among them. Henry
              Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He
              was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He
              loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger , for
              its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry
              and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began
              to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly
              adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to
              enter into masquerades, in which the characters were
              drawn from the
              heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of
              King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their
              blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of
              the infidels.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>No human being could have passed a happier
              childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by
              the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt
              that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot
              according to their caprice, but the agents and
              creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed.
              When I mingled with other families, I distinctly
              discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and
              gratitude assisted the development of filial
              love.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>My
              temper was sometimes violent , and my passions
              vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were
              turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an
              eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things
              indiscriminately. I confess that neither the
              structure of languages, nor the code of governments,
              nor the politics of various states , possessed
              attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and
              earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the
              outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of
              nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied
              me, still my enquiries were directed to the

              secrets of the world.</p>

               <p>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak,
              with the
              moral relations of things. The busy stage of
              life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men,
              were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to
              become one among those whose names are recorded in
              story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of
              our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like
              a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her
              sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the
              sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there
              to bless and animate us. She was the
              living spirit of love to soften and attract: I
              might have become sullen in my study, rough through
              the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to
              subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And
              Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble
              spirit of Clerval?—yet he might not have been
              so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his
              generosity—so full of kindness and tenderness
              amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she
              not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
              beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim
              of his soaring ambition.</p>

               <p>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the
              recollections of childhood, before misfortune had
              tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of
              extensive
              usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections
              upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my
              early days, I also record those events which led, by
              insensible steps to my after tale of misery: for when
              I would account to myself for the birth of that
              passion, which afterwards ruled my destiny,
              I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble
              and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it
              proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its
              course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.</p>

               <p>Natural
              philosophy is the genius that has regulated my
              fate; I desire therefore, in this narration, to state
              those facts which led to my predilection for that
              science.
              When I was thirteen years of age, we all went on a
              party of pleasure to the baths near 
              Thonon: the inclemency of the weather obliged us
              to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I
              chanced to find a volume of the works of 
              Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the
              theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the
              wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this
              feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn
              upon my mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated
              my discovery to my father.
              My father looked carelessly at the title-page of my
              book, and said, "Ah! Cornelius Agrippa. My dear
              Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad
              trash."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken
              the pains to explain to me, that the principles of
              Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a
              modern system of science had been introduced,
              which possessed much greater powers than the ancient,
              because the powers of the latter were chimerical,
              while those of the former were real and practical;
              under such circumstances, I should certainly have
              thrown Agrippa aside, and have contented my
              imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with
              greater ardour to my former studies. It is even
              possible, that the train of my ideas would never have
              received the fatal
              impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory
              glance my father had taken of my volume by no means
              assured me that he was acquainted with its contents;
              and I continued to read with the greatest
              avidity.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>When I returned home, my first care was to procure
              the whole works of this author, and afterwards of
              
              Paracelsus and 
              Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild
              fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared
              to me treasures known to few beside myself; and I
              have described myself as always having been embued
              with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets
              of nature. In spite of the intense labour and
              wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I
              always came from my studies discontented and
              unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed
              that he felt like a
              child picking up shells beside the great and
              unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in
              each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was
              acquainted, appeared even to my boy's apprehensions,
              as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.</p>

               <p>The untaught peasant
              beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted
              with their practical uses. The most learned
              philosopher knew little more. He had partially
              unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal
              lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He
              might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but,
              not
              to speak of a final cause, causes in their
              secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to
              him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and
              impediments that seemed to keep human beings from
              entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and
              ignorantly I had repined.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>But here were books, and here were men who had
              penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word
              for all that they averred, and I became their
              
              disciple. It may appear strange that such should
              arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed
              the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I
              was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to my
              favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and
              I was left to struggle with a child's blindness,
              added to a student's thirst for knowledge. Under the
              guidance of my new preceptors, I entered with the
              greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's
              stone and the elixir of life. But the latter
              soon obtained my undivided attention: wealth was an
              inferior object; but what
              glory would attend the discovery, if I could
              banish disease from the human frame, and render man
              invulnerable to any but a violent death!</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Nor were these my only visions. The raising
              of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally
              accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfillment of
              which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations
              were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure
              rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a
              want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus
              for a time I was occupied by exploded systems,
              mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory
              theories, and floundering desperately in a very
              slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent
              imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident
              again changed the current of my ideas.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired
              to our house near Belrive,
              when we witnessed a most violent and terrible
              thunder-storm. It advanced from behind the
              mountains of 
              Jura; and the thunder burst at once with
              frightful loudness from various quarters of the
              heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching
              its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood
              at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire
              issue from an old and beautiful oak, which stood
              about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the
              dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and
              nothing remained but a blasted
              stump. When we visited it the next morning, we
              found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was
              not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to
              thin ribands of wood. I never beheld anything so
              utterly destroyed.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more
              obvious laws of electricity.
              On this occasion a man of great research in natural
              philosophy was with us, and, excited by this
              catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a
              theory which he had formed on the subject of
              electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and
              astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly
              into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus,
              and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
              some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined
              me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me
              as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that
              had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
              despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind,
              which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth,
              I at once gave up my former occupations; set down
              natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and
              abortive creation; and entertained the greatest
              disdain for a would-be science, which could never
              even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In
              this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics,
              and the branches of study appertaining to that
              science, as being built upon secure foundations, and
              so worthy of my consideration.</p>

               <p>Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by
              such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or
              ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this
              almost miraculous change of inclination and will was
              the immediate suggestion of the
              guardian angel of my life—the last effort
              made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm
              that was even then hanging in the stars, and ready to
              envelope me. Her victory was announced by an unusual
              tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the
              relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting
              studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to
              associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with
              their disregard.</p>

               <p>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but
              it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and
              immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible
              destruction.</p>
