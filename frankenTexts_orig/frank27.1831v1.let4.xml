               <p>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I
              cannot forbear recording it, although it is very
              probable that you will see me before these papers can
              come into your possession.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Last Monday
              (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice,
              which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely
              leaving her the sea-room
              in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat
              dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a
              very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that
              some change would take place in the atmosphere and
              weather.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we
              beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and
              irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end.
              Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to
              grow watchful
              with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight
              suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted
              our solicitude from our own situation. We
              perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn
              by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance
              of half a mile: a
              being which had the shape of a man, but
              apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge,
              and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of
              the traveller with our telescopes, until he was
              lost among the distant inequalities of the
              ice.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We
              were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any
              land; but this
              apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in
              reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in,
              however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his
              track, which we had observed with the greatest
              attention.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard
              the ground
              sea; and before
              night the ice broke, and freed our ship. We,
              however, lay to until the morning, fearing to
              encounter in the dark those large loose masses which
              float about after the breaking up of the ice. I
              profited of this time to rest for a few hours.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light,
              I went upon the deck, and found all the sailors busy
              on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to some
              one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that
              we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in
              the night, on a
              large fragment of ice. Only one
              dog remained alive; but there was a human being
              within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter
              the vessel. He
              was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a
              savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island,
              but an European. When I appeared on deck, the master
              said, "Here is our captain, and he will not allow you
              to perish on the open sea."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in
              English, although with a foreign
              accent. "Before I come on board your vessel,"
              said he, "will you have the kindness to inform me
              whither you are bound?"</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>You may conceive my astonishment
              on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man
              on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should
              have supposed that my vessel would have been a
              resource which he would not have exchanged for the
              most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied,
              however, that we were on a voyage of discovery
              towards the northern pole.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and
              consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if
              you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his
              safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His
              limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully
              emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man
              in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him
              into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the
              fresh air, he fainted.
              We accordingly brought him back to the deck, and
              restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy,
              and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon
              as he showed signs of life, we wrapped him up in
              blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the
              kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered, and ate
              a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able
              to speak; and I often feared that his suffering had
              deprived him of understanding. When he had in some
              measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and
              attended
              on him as much as my duty would permit. I never
              saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have
              generally an expression of wildness, and even
              
              madness; but there are moments when, if any one
              performs an act of kindness towards him, or does him
              any the most trifling service, his whole countenance
              is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence
              and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is
              generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he
              gnashes
              his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes
              that oppresses him.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great
              trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a
              thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be
              tormented by their
              idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose
              restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
              Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come
              so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the
              deepest gloom; and he replied, "To seek one who fled
              from me."</p>
               <p>"And did the man
              whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day
              before we picked you up, we saw some dogs drawing a
              sledge, with a man in it, across the ice."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>This aroused the stranger's attention; and he
              asked a multitude of questions concerning the route
              which the dæmon,
              as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he
              was alone with me, he said,—"I have, doubtless,
              excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good
              people; but you are too considerate to make
              inquiries."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent
              and inhuman in me to trouble you with any
              inquisitiveness of mine."</p>
               <p>"And yet you rescued me from a strange and
              perilous situation; you have benevolently
              restored me to life."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Soon after
              this he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up
              of the ice had destroyed the other sledge? I replied,
              that I could not answer with any degree of certainty;
              for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and
              the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
              before that time; but of this I could not judge.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>From this time the a new spirit of life animated
              the
              decaying frame of the stranger. He manifested the
              greatest eagerness to be upon deck, to watch for the
              sledge which had before appeared; but I have
              persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far
              too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I
              have promised that some one should watch for him, and
              give him instant notice if any new object should
              appear in sight.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange
              occurrence up to the present
              day. The stranger has gradually improved in
              health, but is very silent, and appears uneasy when
              any one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his
              manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the
              sailors are all interested in him, although they have
              had very little communication with him. For my own
              part, I begin to love
              him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief
              fills me with sympathy
              and compassion. He must have been a noble
              creature in his better days, being even now in
              wreck so attractive and amiable.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret,
              that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I
              have found a man who, before his spirit had been
              broken by misery, I should have been happy to have
              possessed as the brother of my heart.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I shall continue my journal concerning the
              stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh
              incidents to record.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>August
              13th, 17--.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>My affection for my guest
              increases every day. He excites at once my admiration
              and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see
              so noble a creature destroyed by misery without
              feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet
              so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he
              speaks, although his words are culled with the
              choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and
              
              unparalleled eloquence.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>He is now much
              recovered from his illness, and is continually on the
              deck, apparently watching for the sledge that
              preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is
              not so
              utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he
              interests himself deeply in the projects of others.
              He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I
              have communicated to him without
              disguise. He entered attentively into all my
              arguments in favour of my eventual success, and into
              every minute detail of the measures I had taken to
              secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he
              evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give
              utterance to the
              burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all
              the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would
              sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to
              the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or
              death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement
              of the knowledge which I sought; for the dominion
              I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes
              of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my
              listener's countenance. At first I perceived that he
              tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands
              before his eyes; and my voice quivered and failed me,
              as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his
              fingers,—a groan burst from his heaving breast.
              I paused;—at length he spoke, in broken
              accents:—"Unhappy man! Do you share
              my madness? Have you drank also of the
              intoxicating draught? Hear me,—let me reveal my
              tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!"</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my
              curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized
              the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many
              hours of repose and tranquil conversation were
              necessary to restore his composure.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he
              appeared to despise himself for being the slave of
              passion; and quelling the dark
              tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse
              concerning myself personally. He asked me the history
              of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told: but
              it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of
              my desire of finding a
              friend—of my thirst for a more intimate
              sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to
              my lot; and expressed my conviction that a man could
              boast of little happiness, who did not enjoy this
              blessing.</p>
            </item>
            <item>"I agree with you,"
            replied the stranger; "we are unfashioned creatures,
            but
            half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than
            ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not
            lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty
            natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human
            creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge
            respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world
            before you, and have no cause for despair. But
            I—I have lost every thing, and cannot
            begin life anew."</item>
            <item>
               <p>As he said this, his countenance became expressive
              of a calm settled grief, that touched me to the
              heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to
              his cabin.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel
              more deeply than he does the beauties
              of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every
              sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems
              still to have the power of elevating his soul from
              earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may
              suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments;
              yet, when he has retired
              into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit,
              that has a halo around him, within whose circle no
              grief or folly ventures.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Will you smile at the enthusiasm
              I express concerning this divine
              wanderer? You would not, if you saw him. You have
              been tutored and refined by books and retirement from
              the world, and you are, therefore, somewhat
              fastidious; but this only renders you the more
              fit to appreciate the extraordinary
              merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have
              endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he
              possesses, that elevates him so immeasurably above
              any other person I ever knew. I believe it to be an
              intuitive discernment; a quick but neverfailing power
              of judgment; a penetration into the causes of things,
              unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a
              facility of expression, and a voice whose varied
              intonations are soul-subduing music.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily
              perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great
              and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, at
              one time, that the memory of these evils should die
              with me; but you have won me to alter my
              determination. You seek for knowledge
              and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that
              the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent
              to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that
              the relation of my disasters will be useful to you;
              yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same
              course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which
              have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may
              deduce an apt moral from my tale; one that may direct
              you if you succeed in your undertaking, and console
              you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences
              which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we
              among the tamer scenes of nature, I might fear to
              encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but
              many things will appear possible in these wild and
              mysterious regions, which would provoke the laughter
              of those unacquainted with the
              ever-varied powers of nature:—nor can I
              doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal
              evidence of the truth
              of the events of which it is composed."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>You may easily imagine
              that I was much gratified by the offered
              communication; yet I could not endure that he should
              renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I
              felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised
              narrative, partly from curiosity,
              and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his
              fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these
              feelings in my answer.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but
              it is useless; my fate
              is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and
              then I shall repose in peace. I understand your
              feeling," continued he, perceiving that I wished to
              interrupt him; "but you are mistaken, my
              friend, if thus you will allow me to name you;
              nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history,
              and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
              determined."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>He then told me, that
              he would commence his narrative the next day when I
              should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the
              warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I
              am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record,
              as
              nearly as possible in his own words, what he has
              related during the day. If I should be engaged, I
              will at least make notes. This manuscript will
              doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure: but to
              me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips,
              with what interest
              and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even
              now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice
              swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with
              all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand
              raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face
              are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and
              harrowing must be his story; frightful the storm
              which embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and
              wrecked it—thus!</p>
