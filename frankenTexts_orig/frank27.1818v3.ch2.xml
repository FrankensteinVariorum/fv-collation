               <p> LONDON was our present point of rest; we
              determined to remain several months in this wonderful
              and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse
              of the men of genius and talent who flourished at
              this time; but this was with me a secondary object; I
              was principally occupied with the means of obtaining
              the information necessary for the completion of my
              promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of
              introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to
              the most
              distinguished natural philosophers.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>If this journey had
              taken place during my days of study and happiness, it
              would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a
              blight had come over my existence, and I only visited
              these people for the sake of the information they
              might give me on the subject in which my interest was
              so terribly profound. Company
              was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my
              mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice
              of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself
              into a transitory peace. But busy uninteresting
              joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw
              an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my
              fellow-men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of
              William and Justine; and to reflect on the events
              connected with those names filled my soul with
              anguish.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>But in Clerval I saw
              the
              image of my former self; he was inquisitive, and
              anxious to gain experience and instruction. The
              difference of manners which he observed was to him an
              inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He
              was for ever busy; and the only check to his
              enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mien.
              I
              tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I
              might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one
              who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed
              by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused
              to accompany him, alleging another engagement,
              that
              I might remain alone. I now also began to collect
              the materials necessary for my new creation, and this
              was to me like the torture of single drops of water
              continually falling on the head. Every thought that
              was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every
              word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to
              quiver, and my heart to palpitate.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> After passing some months in London, we
              received a letter from a person in Scotland, who had
              formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the
              beauties of his native country, and asked us if those
              were not sufficient allurements to induce us to
              prolong our journey as far north as Perth,
              where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept
              this invitation; and I, although I abhorred society,
              wished to view again mountains and streams, and all
              the wondrous works with which Nature
              adorns her chosen dwelling-places.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>We had arrived in
              England at the beginning of October, and it was now
              February. We accordingly determined to commence our
              journey towards the north at the expiration of
              another month. In this expedition we did not intend
              to follow the
              great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor,
              Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving
              to arrive at the completion of this tour about the
              end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments, and
              the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my
              labours in some obscure nook in the northern
              highlands of Scotland.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>We quitted London on
              the 27th of March, and remained a few days at
              
              Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This
              was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic
              oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately
              deer, were all novelties to us.</p>

               <p> From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As
              we entered this city, our minds were filled with the
              remembrance of the events
              that had been transacted there more than a century
              and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had
              collected his forces. This city had remained faithful
              to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause
              to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The
              memory of that unfortunate king, and his companions,
              the amiable Falkland,
              the insolent Gower,
              his
              queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every
              part of the city, which they might be supposed to
              have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a
              dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its
              footsteps. If these feelings had not found an
              imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city
              had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our
              admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque;
              the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely
              Isis,
              which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite
              verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of
              waters, which reflects its
              majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
              domes, embosomed among aged trees.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I enjoyed this scene;
              and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
              memory of the past, and the anticipation of the
              future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During
              my youthful days discontent never visited my mind;
              and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight
              of what is beautiful
              in nature, or the study of what is excellent and
              sublime in the productions of man, could always
              interest my heart, and communicate elasticity to my
              spirits. But I am
              a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and
              I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I
              shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of
              wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and abhorrent
              to myself.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> We passed a considerable period at
              Oxford, rambling among its environs, and endeavouring
              to identify every spot which might relate to the most
              animating epoch of English history. Our little
              voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the
              successive objects that presented themselves. We
              visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and the
              field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my
              soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable
              fears, to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and
              self-sacrifice, of which these sights were the
              monuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I
              dared to
              shake off my chains, and look around me with a
              free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my
              flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into
              my miserable self.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>We left Oxford with
              regret, and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next
              place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of
              this village resembled, to a greater degree, the
              scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower
              scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant
              white Alps, which always attend on the piny mountains
              of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave,
              and the little cabinets of natural history, where the
              curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the
              collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name
              made me tremble, when pronounced by Henry; and I
              hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible
              scene was thus associated.</p>

            <item>
               <p>From Derby still
              journeying northward, we passed two months in
              
              Cumberland and Westmoreland. I could now almost
              fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little
              patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern
              sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of
              the rocky streams, were all familiar and dear sights
              to me. Here also we made some
              acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me
              into happiness. The delight of Clerval was
              proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded
              in the company of men of talent, and he found in his
              own nature greater capacities and resources than he
              could have imagined himself to have possessed while
              he associated with his inferiors. "I could pass my
              life here," said he to me; "and among these mountains
              I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the
              Rhine."</p>

               <p> But he found that a traveller's life is
              one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments.
              His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he
              begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged
              to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for
              something new, which again engages his attention, and
              which also he forsakes for other novelties.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>We had scarcely visited
              the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and
              conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants,
              when the period of our appointment with our Scotch
              friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For
              my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected
              my promise for some time, and I feared the
              effects of the dæmon's disappointment. He might
              remain in Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance on my
              relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at
              every moment from which I might otherwise have
              snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters
              with feverish impatience: if they were delayed, I was
              miserable, and overcome by a thousand fears; and when
              they arrived, and I saw the superscription of
              Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and
              ascertain
              my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend
              followed me, and might expedite my remissness by
              murdering my companion. When these thoughts possessed
              me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed
              him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied
              rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed
              some
              great crime, the consciousness of which haunted
              me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a
              horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of
              crime.</p>

               <p>I visited Edinburgh
              with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
              have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval
              did not like it so well as Oxford; for the antiquity
              of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But the
              beauty and regularity of the
              new town of Edinburgh, its
              romantic castle, and its environs, the most
              delightful in the world, Arthur's Seat, St.
              Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills,
              compensated him for the change, and filled him with
              cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to
              arrive at the termination of my journey.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> We left Edinburgh in a week, passing
              through Coupar, St.
              Andrew's, and along the banks of the Tay, to
              Perth, where our friend expected us. But I was in no
              mood to laugh and talk with strangers, or enter into
              their feelings or plans with the good humour expected
              from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I
              wished to make the
              tour of Scotland alone. "Do you," said I, "enjoy
              yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. I may be
              absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my
              motions, I entreat you: leave me to peace and
              solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope
              it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to
              your own temper."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Henry wished to
              dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this plan, ceased
              to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. "I
              had rather be with you," he said, "in your solitary
              rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not
              know: hasten then, my dear friend, to return, that I
              may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I
              cannot do in your absence."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Having parted from my
              friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of
              Scotland, and finish my work in solitude. I did not
              doubt but that the monster followed me, and would
              discover himself to me when I should have finished,
              that he might receive his companion.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>With this resolution I
              traversed the northern highlands, and fixed on
              one
              of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my
              labours. It was a place fitted for such a work, being
              hardly more than a rock, whose high sides were
              continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was
              barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few
              miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants,
              which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and
              scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.
              Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such
              luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured
              from the
              main land, which was about five miles
              distant.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> On the whole island there were but three
              miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I
              arrived. This I hired. It contained but two rooms,
              and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most
              miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls
              were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I
              ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and
              took possession; an incident which would, doubtless,
              have occasioned some surprise, had not all the senses
              of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid
              poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and
              unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food
              and clothes which I gave; so much does suffering
              blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>In this retreat I
              devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
              when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony
              beach of the sea, to listen to the waves as they
              roared, and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous,
              yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it
              was far different from this desolate
              and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered
              with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in
              the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle
              sky; and, when troubled by the winds, their tumult is
              but as the play of a lively infant, when compared to
              the roarings of the giant ocean.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> In this manner I distributed my
              occupations when I first arrived; but, as I proceeded
              in my labour, it became every day more horrible and
              irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on
              myself to enter my laboratory for several days; and
              at other times I toiled day and night in order to
              complete my work. It was indeed a
              filthy process in which I was engaged. During my
              first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic
              frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my
              employment; my mind was intently fixed on the sequel
              of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of
              my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood,
              and my heart often sickened at the work of my
              hands.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Thus situated, employed
              in the most detestable occupation, immersed
              in a solitude where nothing could for an instant
              call my attention from the actual scene in which I
              was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I
              grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared
              to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes
              fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they
              should encounter the object which I so much dreaded
              to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my
              fellow-creatures, lest when alone he should come to
              claim his companion.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>In the mean time I
              worked on, and my labour was already considerably
              advanced. I looked towards its completion with a
              tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust
              myself to question, but which was intermixed with
              obscure forebodings of evil, that made my heart
              sicken in my bosom.</p>
