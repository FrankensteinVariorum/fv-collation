<p>DAY after day, week after week, passed away on my
              return to Geneva; and I
              could not collect the courage to recommence my
              work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed
              fiend,
              yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the
              task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not
              compose a female without again devoting several
              months to profound study and laborious disquisition.
              I had heard of some discoveries having been made by
              an English
              philosopher, the knowledge of which was material
              to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining
              my father's consent to visit England for this
              purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and
              shrunk from taking the first step in an undertaking
              whose immediate necessity began to appear less
              absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in
              me: my health, which had hitherto declined, was now
              much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the
              memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My
              father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned
              his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating
              the remains of my melancholy, which every now and
              then would return by fits, and with a devouring
              blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these
              moments I took refuge in the most perfect
              solitude. I
              passed whole days on the lake alone in a little
              boat, watching the clouds, and listening to the
              rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the
              fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me
              to some degree of composure; and, on my return, I met
              the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
              and a more cheerful heart.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It was after my return from one of these rambles
              that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed
              me:—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have
              resumed your former pleasures, and seem to be
              returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy,
              and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost
              in conjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday
              an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I
              conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would
              be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on
              us all."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I trembled
              violently at his exordium, and my father
              continued—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I confess, my son, that I have always looked
              forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as
              the
              tie of our domestic comfort, and the stay of my
              declining years. You were attached to each other from
              your earliest infancy; you studied together, and
              appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited
              to one another. But so blind is the experience of
              man, that what I conceived to be the best assistants
              to my plan, may have entirely destroyed it. You,
              perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish
              that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have
              met with another whom you may love; and, considering
              yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this
              struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you
              appear to feel."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my
              cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman
              who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration
              and affection. My future hopes and prospects are
              entirely bound up in the expectation of our
              union."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The expression of your sentiments on this
              subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than
              I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus,
              we shall assuredly be happy, however present events
              may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which
              appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind,
              that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether
              you object to an immediate solemnisation of the
              marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events
              have drawn us from that every-day tranquillity
              befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger;
              yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a
              competent fortune, that an early
              marriage would at all interfere with any future plans
              of honour and utility that you may have formed.
              Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate
              happiness to you, or that a delay on your part would
              cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words
              with candour,
              and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and
              sincerity."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I listened to my father in silence, and remained
              for some time incapable of offering any reply. I
              revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts,
              and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas!
              to me the idea of an immediate union with my
              Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay. I was bound
              by a solemn promise, which I had not yet fulfilled,
              and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold
              miseries might not impend over me and my devoted
              family! Could I enter into a festival with this
              deadly
              weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me
              to the ground. I must perform my engagement, and let
              the monster depart with his mate, before I allowed
              myself to enjoy the delight of an union from which I
              expected peace.</p>
</item>
<item> I remembered also the
            necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
            England, or entering into a long correspondence with
            those philosophers of that country, whose knowledge and
            discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my
            present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the
            desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory:
            besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea
            of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father's
            house, while in habits of familiar intercourse with
            those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful accidents
            might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a
            tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I was
            aware also that I should often lose all self-command,
            all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that
            would possess me during the progress of my unearthly
            occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while
            thus employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be
            achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace
            and happiness. My promise fulfilled, the monster would
            depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some
            accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him, and put
            an end to my
            slavery for ever.</item>
<item>
<p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I
              expressed a wish to visit England; but, concealing
              the true reasons of this request, I clothed my
              desires under a guise which excited no suspicion,
              while I urged my desire with an earnestness that
              easily induced my father to comply. After so long a
              period of an
              absorbing melancholy, that resembled madness in
              its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I
              was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a
              journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied
              amusement would, before my return, have restored me
              entirely to myself.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The duration of my absence was left to my own
              choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the
              period contemplated. One
              paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure
              my having a companion. Without previously
              communicating with me, he had, in concert with
              Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at
              Strasburgh. This interfered with the
              solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my
              task; yet at the commencement of my journey the
              presence of my friend could in no way be an
              impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should
              be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection.
              Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion
              of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times
              force his abhorred presence on me, to remind me of my
              task, or to contemplate its progress?</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was
              understood that my union with Elizabeth should take
              place immediately on my return. My father's age
              rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself,
              there was one reward I promised myself from my
              detested toils—one consolation for my
              unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that
              day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I
              might claim Elizabeth, and forget the past in my
              union with her.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I now made arrangements for my journey; but one
              feeling haunted me, which filled me with fear and
              agitation. During my absence I should leave my
              friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy,
              and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he
              might be by my departure. But he had promised to
              follow me wherever I might go; and would he not
              accompany me to England? This imagination
              was dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch as
              it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonised
              with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of
              this might happen. But through the whole period
              during
              which I was the slave of my creature, I
              allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the
              moment; and my present sensations strongly
              intimated that the fiend would follow me, and exempt
              my family from the danger of his machinations.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It was in the
              latter end of September that I again quitted my
              native country. My journey had been my own
              suggestion, and Elizabeth, therefore, acquiesced: but
              she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my
              suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and
              grief. It had been her care which provided me a
              companion in Clerval -- and yet a man is blind to a
              thousand minute circumstances, which call forth a
              woman's sedulous attention. She longed to bid me
              hasten my return,—a thousand conflicting
              emotions rendered her mute, as she bade me a tearful
              silent farewell.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to
              convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going,
              and careless
              of what was passing around. I remembered only,
              and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on
              it, to order that my chemical instruments should be
              packed to go with me. Filled
              with dreary imaginations, I passed through many
              beautiful and majestic scenes; but my eyes were fixed
              and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne
              of my travels, and the work which was to occupy
              me whilst they endured.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>After some days spent in listless
              indolence, during which I traversed many leagues,
              I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for
              Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast
              between us! He was alive to every new scene; joyful
              when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more
              happy when he beheld it rise, and recommence a new
              day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the
              landscape, and the appearances of the sky. "This is
              what it is to live," he cried, "now I enjoy
              existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore
              are you desponding and sorrowful?" In truth, I was
              occupied by gloomy thoughts, and neither saw the
              descent of the evening star, nor the golden sunrise
              reflected in the Rhine.—And you,
              my friend, would be far more amused with the
              journal
              of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye
              of feeling and delight, than in listening to my
              reflections. I, a miserable
              wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every
              avenue to enjoyment.</p>

<p>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from
              Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take
              shipping for London. During this voyage, we passed
              many willowy islands, and saw several beautiful
              towns. We stayed a day at Manheim, and, on the fifth
              from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at
              Mayence.
              The course of the Rhine below Mayence becomes much
              more picturesque. The river descends rapidly, and
              winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of
              beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing
              on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black
              woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine,
              indeed, presents a
              singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you
              view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking
              tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing
              beneath; and, on the sudden turn of a promontory,
              flourishing vineyards, with green sloping banks, and
              a meandering river, and populous towns occupy the
              scene.</p>

<p>We travelled
              at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of
              the labourers, as we glided down the stream. Even I,
              depressed in mind, and my spirits continually
              agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I
              lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed on the
              cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a
              tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And
              if these were my sensations, who can describe those
              of Henry? He felt as if he had been transported to
              Fairy-land,
              and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. "I have
              seen," he said, "the most beautiful scenes of my own
              country; I have
              visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the
              snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the
              water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which
              would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it
              not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye
              by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake
              agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up
              whirlwinds of water, and gave you an idea of what the
              water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves
              dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the
              priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an
              avalanche, and where their dying voices are still
              said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind;
              I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays
              de Vaud: but this country, Victor, pleases me more
              than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland
              are more majestic and strange; but there is a charm
              in the banks of this divine river, that I never
              before saw equalled. Look at that castle which
              overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island,
              almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely
              trees; and now that group of labourers coming from
              among their vines; and that village half hid in the
              recess of the mountain. Oh, surely, the spirit that
              inhabits and guards this place has a soul
              more in harmony with man, than those who pile the
              glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the
              mountains of our own country."</p>

<p>Clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me
              to record your words, and to dwell on the praise of
              which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being
              formed in the "very
              poetry of nature." His wild
              and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the
              sensibility
              of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent
              affections, and his friendship
              was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the
              worldy-minded teach us to look for only in the
              imagination. But even human
              sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his
              eager mind. The scenery of external
              nature, which others regard only with admiration,
              he loved with ardour:—</p>
<lg>
<l>
                                          "The
                sounding cataract<lb/>
                Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,<lb/>
                The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,<lb/>
                Their colours and their forms, were then to
                him<lb/>
                An appetite; a feeling, and a love,<lb/>
                That had no need of a remoter charm,<lb/>
                By thought supplied, or any interest<lb/>
                Unborrow'd from the eye"*

<p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and
              lovely being lost forever? Has this mind, so replete
              with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent,
              which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
              life of its creator;—has
              this mind perished?
              Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not
              thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with
              beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
              consoles your unhappy friend.</p>

<p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual
              words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled
              worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing
              with the anguish which his remembrance
              creates. I
              will proceed with my tale.</p>

<p>Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of
              Holland; and we resolved to
              post the remainder of our way; for the
              wind was contrary, and the stream of the river was
              too gentle to aid us.</p>

<p>Our journey here lost the interest arising from
              beautiful scenery; but we arrived in a few days at
              Rotterdam,
              whence we proceeded by sea to England. It was on a
              clear morning, in the latter
              days of December, that I first saw the white
              cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented
              a new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost
              every town was marked by the remembrance of some
              story. We saw Tilbury
              Fort, and remembered the Spanish armada;
              Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich, places which I
              had heard of even in my country.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>At length we saw the numerous steeples of London,
              St. Paul's towering above all, and the Tower famed in
              English history.<lb/>
