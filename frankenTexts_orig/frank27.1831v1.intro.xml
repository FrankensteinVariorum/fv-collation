            <item>
               <p>The
              Publishers of the Standard Novels, in selecting
              "Frankenstein" for one of their series, expressed a
              wish that I should furnish them with some account of
              the origin of the story. I am the more willing to
              comply, because I shall thus give a general answer to
              the question, so frequently asked me—"How I,
              then a young
              girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so
              very hideous an idea?" It is true that I am very
              averse to bringing myself forward in print; but as my
              account will only appear as an appendage to a former
              production, and as it will be confined to such topics
              as have connection with my authorship alone, I can
              scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>It is not singular
              that, as the
              daughter of two persons of distinguished literary
              celebrity, I should very early in life have
              thought of writing. As a child I scribbled; and my
              favourite pastime, during the hours given me for
              recreation, was to "write stories." Still I had a
              dearer pleasure than this, which was the formation of
              castles in the air—the indulging in waking
              dreams—the following up trains of thought,
              which had for their subject the formation of a
              succession of imaginary incidents. My dreams were
              at once more fantastic and agreeable than my
              writings. In the latter I was a close
              imitator—rather doing as others had done, than
              putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I
              wrote was intended at least for one other
              eye—my
              childhood's companion and friend; but my dreams
              were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody; they
              were my refuge when annoyed—my dearest pleasure
              when free.</p>
            </item>
            <item>I lived
            principally in the country as a girl, and passed a
            considerable time in Scotland. I made occasional visits
            to the more picturesque parts; but my habitual
            residence was on the blank and dreary northern shores
            of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on
            retrospection I call them; they were not so to me then.
            They were the eyry of freedom, and the pleasant region
            where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of my
            fancy. I wrote then—but in a most common-place
            style. It was beneath the trees of the grounds
            belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides of the
            woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the
            airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered.
            I did not make myself the heroine of my tales. Life
            appeared to me too common-place an affair as regarded
            myself. I could not figure to myself that romantic woes
            or wonderful events would ever be my lot; but I was not
            confined to my own identity, and I
            could people the hours with creations far more
            interesting to me at that age, than my own
            sensations.</item>
            <item>
               <p>After this my life
              became busier, and reality stood in place of fiction.
              My husband, however, was from the first, very anxious
              that I should prove myself worthy
              of my parentage, and enrol myself on the page of
              fame. He was for ever inciting me to obtain literary
              reputation, which even on my own part I cared for
              then, though since I have become infinitely
              indifferent to it. At this time he desired that I
              should write, not so much with the idea that I could
              produce any thing worthy of notice, but that he might
              himself judge how far I possessed the promise of
              better things hereafter. Still I did nothing.
              Travelling, and the cares of a family, occupied my
              time; and study, in the way of reading, or improving
              my ideas in communication with his far more
              cultivated mind, was all of literary employment that
              engaged my attention.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>In the summer of 1816,
              we visited Switzerland, and became
              the neighbours of Lord Byron. At first we spent
              our pleasant hours on the lake, or wandering on its
              shores; and Lord Byron, who was writing the third
              canto of Childe Harold, was the only one among us
              who put his thoughts upon paper. These, as he brought
              them successively to us, clothed in all the light and
              harmony of poetry, seemed to stamp as divine the
              glories of heaven and earth, whose influences we
              partook with him.</p>

            <item>
               <p>But it
              proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain
              often confined us for days to the house. Some
              volumes of ghost stories, translated from the
              German into French, fell into our hands. There was
              the History of the Inconstant Lover, who, when he
              thought to clasp the bride to whom he had pledged his
              vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of
              her whom he had deserted. There was the tale of the
              sinful founder of his race, whose miserable doom it
              was to bestow the kiss of death on all the younger
              sons of his fated house, just when they reached the
              age of promise. His gigantic, shadowy form, clothed
              like the ghost in Hamlet, in complete armour, but
              with the beaver up, was seen at midnight, by the
              moon's fitful beams, to advance slowly along the
              gloomy avenue. The shape was lost beneath the shadow
              of the castle walls; but soon a gate swung back, a
              step was heard, the door of the chamber opened, and
              he advanced to the couch of the blooming youths,
              cradled in healthy sleep. Eternal sorrow sat upon his
              face as he bent down and kissed the forehead of the
              boys, who from that hour withered like flowers snapt
              upon the stalk. I have not seen these stories since
              then; but their incidents are as fresh in my mind as
              if I had read them yesterday.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"We will each write a
              ghost story," said Lord Byron; and his proposition
              was acceded to. There were four of us. The noble
              author began a tale, a fragment of which he printed
              at the end of his poem of Mazeppa. Shelley, more apt
              to embody ideas and sentiments in the radiance of
              brilliant imagery, commenced one founded on the
              experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori
              had some
              terrible idea about a skull-headed lady, who was
              so punished for peeping through a key-hole—what
              to see I forget—something very shocking and
              wrong of course; but when she was reduced to a worse
              condition than the
              renowned Tom of Coventry, he did not know what to
              do with her, and was obliged to despatch her to
              the
              tomb of the Capulets, the only place for which
              she was fitted. The illustrious poets also, annoyed
              by the platitude of prose, speedily relinquished the
              uncongenial task.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I busied myself to
              think of a story, —a story to rival those
              which had excited us to this task. One which would
              speak to the mysterious fears of our nature, and
              awaken thrilling horror—one to make the reader
              dread to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken
              the beatings of the heart. If I did not accomplish
              these things, my ghost story would be unworthy of its
              name. I thought and pondered—vainly. I felt
              that
              blank incapability of invention which is the
              greatest misery of authorship, when dull Nothing
              replies to our anxious invocations. Have you
              thought of a story? I was asked each morning, and
              each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying
              negative.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Every thing must have a
              beginning, to speak in
              Sanchean phrase; and that beginning must be
              linked to something that went before. The Hindoos
              give the world an elephant to support it, but they
              make the
              elephant stand upon a tortoise. Invention, it
              must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating
              out of void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in
              the first place, be afforded: it can give form to
              dark, shapeless substances, but cannot bring into
              being the substance itself. In all matters of
              discovery and invention, even of those that appertain
              to the imagination, we are continually reminded of
              the
              story of Columbus and his egg. Invention consists
              in the capacity of seizing on the capabilities of a
              subject, and in the power of moulding and fashioning
              ideas suggested to it.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Many and long were the
              conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to
              which I was a devout but nearly silent listener.
              During one of these, various philosophical doctrines
              were discussed, and among others the nature of the
              principle of life, and whether there was any
              probability of its ever being discovered and
              communicated. They talked of the experiments of
              Dr.
              Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really
              did, or said that he did, but, as more to my purpose,
              of what was then spoken of as having been done by
              him,) who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass
              case, till by some extraordinary means it
              began to move with voluntary motion. Not thus,
              after all, would life be given. Perhaps a corpse
              would be re-animated; galvanism
              had given token of such things: perhaps the
              component parts of a creature might be manufactured,
              brought together, and endued with vital warmth.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Night waned upon this
              talk, and even the witching hour had gone by, before
              we retired to rest. When I placed my head on my
              pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to
              think. My
              imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me,
              gifting the successive images that arose in my mind
              with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of
              reverie. I saw—with shut eyes, but acute mental
              vision, —I saw the pale student of unhallowed
              arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I
              saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and
              then, on the
              working of some powerful engine, show signs of
              life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion.
              Frightful
              must it be; for supremely frightful would be the
              effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous
              mechanism of the Creator of the world. His success
              would terrify the artist; he would rush away from his
              odious handywork, horror-stricken. He would hope
              that, left to itself, the slight spark of life which
              he had communicated would fade; that this thing,
              which had received such imperfect animation, would
              subside into dead matter; and he might sleep in the
              belief that the silence of the grave would quench for
              ever the transient existence of the hideous corpse
              which he had looked upon as the cradle of life. He
              sleeps; but he is awakened; he opens his eyes; behold
              the horrid thing stands at his bedside, opening his
              curtains, and looking on him with yellow, watery, but
              speculative eyes.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I opened mine in
              terror. The idea so possessed my mind, that a thrill
              of fear ran through me, and I wished to exchange the
              ghastly image of my fancy for the realities around.
              I
              see them still; the very room, the dark
              parquet, the closed shutters, with the
              moonlight struggling through, and the sense I had
              that the glassy lake and white high Alps were beyond.
              I could not so easily get rid of my hideous phantom;
              still it haunted me. I must try to think of something
              else. I recurred to my ghost story, my tiresome
              unlucky ghost story! O! if I could only contrive one
              which would frighten my reader as I myself had been
              frightened that night!</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Swift as light and as
              cheering was the idea that broke in upon me. "I have
              found it! What terrified me will terrify others; and
              I need only describe the spectre which had haunted my
              midnight pillow." On the morrow I announced that I
              had thought of a story. I began that day with
              the words, It
              was on a dreary night of November , making
              only a transcript of the grim terrors of my waking
              dream.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>At first I thought but
              of a few pages of a
              short tale; but Shelley urged me to develope the
              idea at greater length. I
              certainly did not owe the suggestion of one
              incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling,
              to my husband, and yet but for his incitement, it
              would never have taken the form in which it was
              presented. From this declaration I must except the
              preface. As far as I can recollect, it was entirely
              written by him.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>And now, once again, I
              bid my
              hideous progeny go forth and prosper. I have an
              affection for it, for it was the offspring of happy
              days, when death and grief were but words, which
              found no true echo in my heart. Its several pages
              speak of many a walk, many a drive, and many a
              conversation, when I was not alone; and my companion
              was one who, in this world, I shall never see more.
              But this is for myself; my readers have nothing to do
              with these associations.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I will add but one word
              as to the alterations I have made. They are
              principally those of style. I
              have changed no portion of the story, nor
              introduced any new ideas or circumstances. I have
              mended the language where it was so bald as to
              interfere with the interest of the narrative; and
              these changes occur almost exclusively in the
              beginning of the first volume. Throughout they are
              entirely confined to such parts as are mere adjuncts
              to the story, leaving the core and substance of it
              untouched.</p>
