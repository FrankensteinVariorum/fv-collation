               <p>To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.</p>
               <p>August 5th, 17--.</p>
               <p>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it, although it
									is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Last Monday (July 31st), we
									were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the searoom in which she floated. Our situation was
									somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that
									some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction,
									vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began
									to grow  watchful with anxious thoughts, when a
									strange sight suddenly attracted our attention, and 
										diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn
									by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently
									of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with
									our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant
									inequalities of the ice.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles
									from any land; but  this apparition seemed to denote that
										it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to
									follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice broke, and freed our ship. We,
									however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about
									after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon the deck, and found all the
									sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like
									that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being
									within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage
										inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, "Here
									is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a  foreign accent. "Before I come on board your
									vessel," said he, "will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?"</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I
									should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most
									precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
									northern pole.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God!
									Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.
									His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so
									wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the
									deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As
									soon as he shewed signs of life, we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the
									kitchen-stove. By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often feared that his
									sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own
									cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty would
									permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are moments when, if any-one
									performs an act of kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is
									lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally
									melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he  gnashes his
										teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished
									to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by  their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind
									whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so
									far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he replied, "To seek
									one who fled from me."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"And did the  man whom you pursued
									travel in the same fashion?"</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs
									drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice."</p>
            </item>

               <p>This aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the
									route which the dæmon, as he called him, had
									pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, "I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as
									that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any
									inquisitiveness of mine."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life."</p>

               <p>Soon after this he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the
									other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the ice had not broken until
									near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not
									judge. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>From this time the stranger seemed very eager to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge
									which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the
									rawness of the atmosphere. But I have promised that some one should watch for him, and give him instant notice if
									any new object should appear in sight. </p>

               <p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in
									health, but is very silent, and appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so
									conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little
									communication with him. For my own part, I begin to  love
										him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills me with  sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now
									in wreck so attractive and amiable.</p>

               <p>I said in one of my letters,
									my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit
									had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh
									incidents to record.</p>

               <p>My affection for my guest
									increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see  so noble a creature destroyed by misery without
									feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he speaks,
									although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and  unparalleled eloquence.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck, apparently
									watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he
									interests himself deeply in the employments of others. He has asked me many questions concerning my design; and I
									have related my little history frankly to him. He
									appeared pleased with the confidence, and suggested several alterations in my plan, which I shall find exceedingly
									useful. There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears to spring solely from the interest he
									instinctively takes in the welfare of those who surround him. He is often overcome by gloom, and then he sits by
									himself, and tries to overcome all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour. These paroxysms pass from him like a
									cloud from before the sun, though his dejection never
									leaves him. I have endeavoured to win his confidence; and I trust that I have succeeded. One day I mentioned to
									him the desire I had always felt of finding  a friend who
										might sympathize with me, and direct me by his counsel. I said, I did not belong to that class of men who
									are offended by advice. "I am self-educated, and
									perhaps I hardly rely sufficiently upon my own powers. I wish therefore that my companion should be wiser and more
									experienced than myself, to confirm and support me; nor have I believed it impossible to find a true friend."</p>

            <item>
               <p>"I agree with you," replied the stranger, "in believing that friendship is not only a
									desirable, but a possible acquisition.  I once had a
										friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You
									have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost every thing, and
										 cannot begin life anew."</p>

               <p>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched me
									to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his cabin.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the  beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and
									every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.
									Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet when he has  retired into himself, he will be like a celestial
									spirit, that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</p>

               <p>Will you laugh at the enthusiasm I express concerning this  divine
									wanderer? If you do, you must have certainly lost that simplicity which was once your characteristic charm.
									Yet, if you will, smile at the warmth of my expressions, while I find every day new causes for repeating them.</p>

               <p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have
									suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, once, that the memory of these evils should die
									with me; but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for  knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I
									ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not
									know that the relation of my misfortunes will be useful to you, yet, if you are inclined, listen to my tale. I
									believe that the strange incidents connected with it will afford a view of  nature, which may enlarge your faculties and
									understanding. You will hear of powers and occurrences, such as you have been accustomed to believe impossible:
									but I do not doubt that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the  truth of the events of which it is composed."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>You may easily conceive that I was much gratified by the offered communication; yet I could
									not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear
									the promised narrative, partly from  curiosity, and
									partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my
									answer. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but it is useless; my  fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event,
									and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling," continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt
									him; "but you are mistaken,  my friend, if thus you
									will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will perceive how
									irrevocably it is determined."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at
									leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I am not engaged, to
									record,  as nearly as possible in his own words,
									what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will
									doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure: but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what
										 interest and sympathy shall I read it in some
									future day!</p>
