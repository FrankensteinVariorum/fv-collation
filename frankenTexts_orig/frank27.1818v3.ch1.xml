            <item>
               <p> DAY after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work.
						I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined
						me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious
						disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material
						to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father's consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to
						every pretence of delay, and could not resolve to interrupt my returning tranquillity. My health, which had hitherto declined,
						was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw
						this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
						which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these
						moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the
						clouds, and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to
						restore me to some degree of composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more
						cheerful heart.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me:—</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet
						you are still unhappy, and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this; but
						yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only
						useless, but draw down treble misery on us all."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> I trembled violently at this exordium, and my father continued—</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with your cousin as the tie of our domestic comfort, and
						the stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and
						appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man, that what I
						conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister,
						without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and, considering
						yourself as bound in honour to your cousin, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth
						does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our
						union."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The expression of your sentiments on this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time
						experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this
						gloom, which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you
						object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that
						every-day tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a
						competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have
						formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you, or that a delay on your part would cause me any
						serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with candour, and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind
						a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my
						cousin was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise, which I had not yet fulfilled, and dared not break; or,
						if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this
						deadly weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must perform my engagement, and let the monster depart
						with his mate, before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of an union from which I expected peace.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England, or entering into a long correspondence with
						those philosophers of that country, whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking.
						The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory: besides, any variation was agreeable
						to me, and I was delighted with the idea of spending a year or two in change of scene and variety of occupation, in absence
						from my family; during which period some event might happen which would restore me to them in peace and happiness: my promise
						might be fulfilled, and the monster have departed; or some accident might occur to destroy him, and put an end to my slavery
						for ever.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England; but, concealing the true reasons of this
						request, I clothed my desires under the guise of wishing to travel and see the world before I sat down for life within the
						walls of my native town.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was easily induced to comply; for a more indulgent and less dictatorial
						parent did not exist upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I should travel to Strasburgh, where Clerval would join me. Some
						short time would be spent in the towns of Holland, and our principal stay would be in England. We should return by France; and
						it was agreed that the tour should occupy the space of two years.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>My father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return to
						Geneva. "These two years," said he, "will pass swiftly, and it will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your
						happiness. And, indeed, I earnestly desire that period to arrive, when we shall all be united, and neither hopes or fears
						arise to disturb our domestic calm."</p>
            </item>

               <p>"I am content," I replied, "with your arrangement. By that time we shall both have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we at
						present are." I sighed; but my father kindly forbore to question me further concerning the cause of my dejection. He hoped
						that new scenes, and the amusement of travelling, would restore my tranquillity.</p>

               <p>I now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling haunted me, which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence
						I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he
						might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go; and would he not accompany me to England? This
						imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonized with the
						idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my
						creature, I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the
						fiend would follow me, and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.</p>

               <p> It was in the latter end of August that I departed, to pass two years of exile. Elizabeth approved of the reasons of my
						departure, and only regretted that she had not the same opportunities of enlarging her experience, and cultivating her
						understanding. She wept, however, as she bade me farewell, and entreated me to return happy and tranquil. "We all," said she,
						"depend upon you; and if you are miserable, what must be our feelings?"</p>

               <p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was
						passing around. I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical
						instruments should be packed to go with me: for I resolved to fulfil my promise while abroad, and return, if possible, a free
						man. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes; but my eyes were fixed and
						unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my travels, and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.</p>

               <p>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two
						days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene; joyful when he saw
						the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the
						shifting colours of the landscape, and the appearances of the sky. "This is what it is to live," he cried, "now I enjoy
						existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful?" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
						thoughts, and neither saw the descent of the evening star, nor the golden sun-rise reflected in the Rhine.—And you, my friend,
						would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than to
						listen to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.</p>

               <p> We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During
						this voyage, we passed many willowy islands, and saw several beautiful towns. We staid a day at Manheim, and, on the fifth
						from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below Mayence becomes much more picturesque.
						The river descends rapidly, and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles
						standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,
						presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous
						precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and, on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards, with green
						sloping banks, and a meandering river, and populous towns, occupy the scene.</p>

               <p> We travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of the labourers, as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed
						in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as
						I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were
						my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness
						seldom tasted by man. "I have seen," he said, "the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of
						Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades,
						which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
						appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water, and gave you an idea of
						what the water-spout must be on the great ocean, and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and
						his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche, and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
						nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud: but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all
						those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange; but there is a charm in the banks of this divine
						river, that I never before saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island,
						almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and
						that village half-hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely, the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul
						more in harmony with man, than those who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own
						country."</p>

               <p>Clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words, and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently
						deserving. He was a being formed in the "very poetry of nature." His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the
						sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous
						nature that the worldy-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
						satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:</p>

                  <l>------ "The sounding cataract<lb/> Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,<lb/> The mountain, and the deep and gloomy
							wood,<lb/> Their colours and their forms, were then to him<lb/> An appetite; a feeling, and a love,<lb/> That had no need
							of a remoter charm,<lb/> By thought supplied, or any interest<lb/> Unborrowed from the eye."</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever? Has this mind so replete with ideas, imaginations
						fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator; has this mind perished?
						Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed,
						but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.</p>

               <p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe

               <p> Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way; for the wind was

               <p>Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery; but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we
						proceeded by sea to England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of September, that I first saw the white cliffs of
						Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the
						remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort, and remembered the Spanish armada; Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich, places
						which I had heard of even in my country.</p>
