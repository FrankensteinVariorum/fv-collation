               <p>NOTHING is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the
						dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Justine died; she rested;
						and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart, which nothing
						could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond
						description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself), was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness, and the
						love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice,
						and make myself useful to my fellow-beings. Now all was blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience, which allowed me to
						look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and
						the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures, such as no language can describe.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I
						shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark,
						deathlike solitude.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits, and endeavoured by arguments deduced from
						the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life, to inspire me with fortitude, and awaken in me the courage to dispel
						the dark cloud which brooded over me. "Do you think, Victor," said he, "that I do not suffer also? No one could love a child
						more than I loved your brother;" (tears came into his eyes as he spoke); "but is it not a duty to the survivors, that we
						should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself; for
						excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for
						society."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief, and console my
						friends, if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my
						father with a look of despair, and endeavour to hide myself from his view.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates
						regularly at ten o'clock, and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour, had rendered our residence within
						the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took
						the boat, and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after
						rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course, and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I
						was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so
						beautiful and heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I
						approached the shore—often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my
						calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and
						whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father, and surviving brother: should I by my base desertion leave
						them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and
						happiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils; and I lived in
						daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was
						not over, and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the
						past. There was always scope for fear, so long as any thing I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be
						conceived. When I thought of him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life
						which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of
						moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to
						their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head, and avenge the deaths
						of William and Justine</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Our house was the house of mourning. My father's health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad
						and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead;
						eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no
						longer that happy creature, who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake, and talked with ecstasy of our
						future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth, had visited her, and its dimming
						influence quenched her dearest smiles.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"When I reflect, my dear cousin," said she, "on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works
						as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice, that I read in books or heard from
						others, as tales of ancient days, or imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more familiar to reason than to the
						imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's blood. Yet I am
						certainly unjust. Every body believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she
						suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered
						the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her
						own! I could not consent to the death of any human being; but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain
						in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms
						me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel if I were

						William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But

               <p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my
						anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand said, "My dearest friend, you must calm yourself. These events have
						affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of
						revenge, in your countenance, that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around you,
						who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy? Ah! while we love—while we are true to each
						other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing,—what can disturb our
						peace?"</p>

               <p>And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune, suffice to chase away the fiend that
						lurked in my heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror; lest at that very moment the destroyer had been
						near to rob me of her. Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul
						from woe: the very accents of love were ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could
						penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had
						pierced it, and to die—was but a type of me.</p>

               <p>Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me: but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to
						seek, by bodily exercise and hy change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It was during an access of this
						kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the
						eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards the
						valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: I was a wreck—but nought
						had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.</p>

               <p>I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed, and least liable to
						receive injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine: it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months
						after the death of Justine; that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly
						lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every
						side—the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around, spoke of a power mighty as
						Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear, or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the
						elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and
						astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here
						and there peeping forth from among the trees, formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by
						the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations
						of another race of beings.</p>

               <p>I passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain
						that overhangs it. Soon after I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so
						beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate
						boundaries; but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling
						thunder of the falling avalanche, and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc,
						raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles , and its tremendous dôme overlooked the valley.</p>

               <p>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. Some turn in the road, some new object
						suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the light-hearted gaiety of boyhood.
						The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal nature bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence ceased
						to act—I found myself fettered again to grief, and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal,
						striving so to forget the world, my fears, and, more than all, myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted, and threw
						myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.</p>

               <p>At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I
						had endured. For a short space of time I remained at the window, watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc,
						and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to
						my too keen sensations: when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came, and blest the giver
						of oblivion.</p>
