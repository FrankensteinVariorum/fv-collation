               <p>"I LAY on my straw,
              but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences
              of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle
              manners of these people; and I longed to join them,
              but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I
              had suffered the night before from the barbarous
              villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I
              might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for
              the present I
              would remain quietly in my hovel, watching, and
              endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced
              their actions.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The cottagers arose the next morning before
              the sun. The young woman arranged the cottage,
              and prepared the food; and the youth departed after
              the first meal.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"This day was passed in the same routine as that
              which preceded it. The young man was constantly
              employed out of doors, and the girl in various
              laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I
              soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure
              hours on his instrument or in contemplation. Nothing
              could exceed the love
              and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited
              towards their venerable companion. They performed
              towards him every little office of affection and duty
              with gentleness; and he rewarded them by his
              benevolent smiles.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"They were not
              entirely happy. The young man and his companion often
              went apart, and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for
              their unhappiness; but I was deeply affected by it.
              If such
              lovely creatures were miserable, it was less
              strange that I, an imperfect
              and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why
              were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a
              delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and
              every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when
              chill, and delicious viands when hungry; they were
              dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they
              enjoyed one another's company and speech,
              interchanging each day looks of affection and
              kindness. What
              did their tears imply? Did they really express
              pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions;
              but perpetual attention and time explained to me many
              appearances which were at first enigmatic.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered
              one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable
              family: it was poverty;
              and they suffered that evil in a very distressing
              degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the
              vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one cow,
              which gave very little during the winter, when its
              masters could scarcely procure food to support it.
              They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger
              very poignantly, especially the two younger
              cottagers; for several times they placed food before
              the old man, when they reserved none for
              themselves.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"This trait of kindness
              moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the
              night, to steal a part of their store for my own
              consumption; but when I found that in doing this I
              inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, and
              satisfied myself with berries,
              nuts, and roots, which I gathered from a
              neighbouring wood.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I discovered also
              another means through which I was enabled to assist
              their labours. I found that the youth spent a great
              part of each day in collecting wood for the family
              fire; and, during the night, I often took his tools,
              the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought
              home firing sufficient for the consumption of several
              days.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I remember, the first time that I did this, the
              young woman, when she opened the door in the morning,
              appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of
              wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud
              voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed
              surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not
              go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing
              the cottage, and cultivating the garden.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater
              moment. I found that these people possessed a method
              of communicating their experience and feelings to one
              another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the
              words they spoke sometimes, produced pleasure or
              pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and
              countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a
              godlike
              science, and I ardently desired to become
              acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every
              attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation
              was quick; and the words they uttered, not having any
              apparent connexion with visible objects, I was unable
              to discover any clue by which I could unravel the
              mystery of their reference. By great application,
              however, and after having remained during the space
              of several
              revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I
              discovered the names that were given to some of
              the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and
              applied the words, fire, milk,
              bread, and wood. I learned also the
              names
              of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his
              companion had each of them several names, but the old
              man had only one, which was father. The girl
              was called sister, or Agatha; and the
              youth Felix, brother, or son. I
              cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the
              ideas appropriated to each of these sounds, and was
              able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other
              words, without being able as yet to understand
              or apply them; such as good,
              dearest, unhappy.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I spent the winter
              in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the
              cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were
              unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced,
              I
              sympathised in their joys. I saw few human beings
              beside them; and if any other happened to enter the
              cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only
              enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my
              friends. The old man, I could perceive, often
              endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I
              found that he called them, to cast off their
              melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with
              an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even
              upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes
              sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to
              wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her
              countenance and tone were more cheerful after having
              listened to the exhortations
              of her father. It was not thus with Felix. He was
              always the saddest of the group; and, even to my
              unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more
              deeply than his friends. But if his countenance was
              more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that
              of his sister, especially when he addressed the old
              man.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I could mention innumerable instances, which,
              although slight, marked the dispositions of these
              amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want,
              Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the
              
              first little white flower that peeped out from
              beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning,
              before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that
              obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water
              from the well, and brought the wood from the
              out-house, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he
              found his store always replenished by an invisible
              hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for
              a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth,
              and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood
              with him. At other times he worked in the garden;
              but, as there was little to do in the frosty season,
              he read to the old man and Agatha.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"This reading had
              puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I
              discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds
              when he read, as when he talked. I conjectured,
              therefore, that he found on the paper signs for
              speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to
              comprehend these also; but how was that possible,
              when I did not even understand the sounds for which
              they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in
              this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any
              kind of conversation, although I applied my whole
              mind to the endeavour: for I easily perceived that,
              although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the
              cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I
              had first become master of their language; which
              knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the
              deformity of my figure; for with this also the
              contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me
              acquainted.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers
              -- their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions: but
              how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in a
              transparent pool! At first I started back, unable
              to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in
              the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that
              I
              was in reality the monster that I am, I was
              filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence
              and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know
              the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"As the sun became warmer, and the light of day
              longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare
              trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was
              more employed; and the heart-moving indications of
              impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I
              afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome;
              and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new
              kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which
              they
              dressed; and these signs of comfort increased
              daily as the season advanced.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The old man,
              leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it
              did not rain, as I found it was called when the
              heavens poured forth its waters. This
              frequently took place; but a high wind quickly
              dried the earth, and the season became far more
              pleasant than it had been.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During
              the morning, I attended the motions of the cottagers;
              and when they were dispersed in various occupations,
              I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in
              observing my friends. When they had retired to rest,
              if there was any moon, or the night was star-light, I
              went into the woods, and collected my own food and
              fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it
              was necessary, I cleared their path of the snow, and
              performed those offices that I had seen done by
              Felix. I afterwards found that these labours,
              performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished
              them; and once or twice I heard them, on these
              occasions, utter the words good
              spirit , wonderful; but I did not then
              understand the signification of these terms.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed
              to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely
              creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix
              appeared so miserable, and Agatha so sad. I thought
              (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to
              restore happiness to these deserving people. When I
              slept, or was absent, the forms of the venerable
              blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent
              Felix, flitted before me. I looked upon them as
              superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my
              future destiny. I formed in my
              imagination a thousand pictures of presenting
              myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined
              that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle
              demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win
              their favour, and afterwards their love.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to
              apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art
              of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but
              supple: and although my voice was very unlike the
              soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such
              words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as
              the
              ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass,
              whose intentions were affectionate, although his
              manners were rude, deserved
              better treatment than blows and execration.</p>

            <item>
               <p>"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring
              greatly altered the aspect of the earth. Men, who
              before this change seemed to have been hid in caves,
              dispersed themselves, and were employed in various
              arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful
              notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the
              trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods,
              which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and
              unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the
              enchanting appearance of nature;
              the past
              was blotted from my memory, the present was
              tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of
              hope, and anticipations
              of joy.</p>
