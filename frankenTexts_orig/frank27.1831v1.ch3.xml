            <item>
               <p>WHEN I had attained the age of seventeen, my
              parents resolved that I should become a student at
              the university
              of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the schools of
              Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the
              completion of my education,
              that I should be made acquainted with other customs
              than those of my native country. My departure was
              therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day
              resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of
              my life occurred—an
              omen, as it were, of my future misery.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Elizabeth had caught the scarlet
              fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the
              greatest danger. During her illness, many arguments
              had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from
              attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our
              entreaties; but when she heard that the life of her
              favourite was menaced, she could no longer control
              her anxiety. She attended her sick bed,—her
              watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of
              the distemper,—Elizabeth was saved, but the
              consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her
              preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her
              fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms,
              and the looks of her medical attendants
              prognosticated the worst event. On her death-bed
              the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did
              not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and
              myself:—"My children," she said, "my firmest
              hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect
              of your union. This expectation will now be the
              consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you
              must supply my place to my younger children. Alas! I
              regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and
              beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you
              all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will
              endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death, and
              will indulge a hope of meeting you in another
              world."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>She died calmly; and her countenance expressed
              affection even in death. I need not describe the
              feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that
              most irreparable evil; the void that presents itself
              to the soul; and the despair that is exhibited on the
              countenance. It is so long before the mind can
              persuade itself that she,
              whom we saw every day, and whose very existence
              appeared a part of our own, can have departed for
              ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can
              have been extinguished, and the sound of a voice so
              familiar, and dear to the ear, can be hushed, never
              more to be heard. These are the reflections of the
              first days; but when the lapse of time proves the
              reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of
              grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand
              rent away some dear connection? and why should I
              describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?
              The time at length arrives, when grief is rather an
              indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays
              upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege,
              is not banished. My
              mother was dead, but we had still duties
              which we ought to perform; we must continue our
              course with the rest, and learn to think ourselves
              fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has
              not seized.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been
              deferred by these events, was now again determined
              upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some
              weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave
              the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning,
              and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to
              sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was
              unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to
              me; and, above all, I desired to see my sweet
              Elizabeth in some degree consoled.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>She indeed veiled her grief, and strove to act the
              comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life, and
              assumed
              its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted
              herself to those whom she had been taught to call her
              uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at
              this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her
              smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot
              even her own regret in her endeavours to make us
              forget.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval
              spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to
              persuade his
              father to permit him to accompany me, and to
              become my fellow student; but in vain. His father was
              a narrow-minded trader,
              and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and
              ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune
              of being debarred from a liberal education. He said
              little; but when he spoke, I read in his kindling eye
              and in his animated glance a restrained but firm
              resolve, not to be chained to the miserable details
              of commerce.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from
              each other, nor persuade ourselves to say the word
              "Farewell!" It was said; and we retired under the
              pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the
              other was deceived: but when at morning's dawn I
              descended to the carriage which was to convey me
              away, they were all there—my father again to
              bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my
              Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write
              often, and to bestow the last feminine attentions on
              her playmate and friend.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey
              me away, and indulged in the most melancholy
              reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
              amiable companions, continually engaged in
              endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure, I
              was now alone. In the university, whither I was
              going, I must form my own friends, and be my own
              protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably
              secluded and domestic; and this had given me
              invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my
              brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were
              "old
              familiar faces"; but I believed myself totally
              unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my
              reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I
              proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I
              ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I
              had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain
              during my youth cooped up in one place, and had
              longed to enter the world, and take my station among
              other human beings. Now my desires were complied
              with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
              repent.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other
              reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which
              was long
              and fatiguing. At length the high
              white steeple of the town met my eyes. I
              alighted, and was conducted to my solitary apartment,
              to spend the evening as I pleased.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>The next morning I delivered my letters of
              introduction, and paid a visit to some of the
              principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil
              influence, the
              Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent
              sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant
              steps from my father's door—led me first to
              M.
              Krempe, professor
              of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but
              deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He asked
              me several questions concerning my progress in the
              different branches of science appertaining to natural
              philosophy. I replied carelessly; and, partly in
              contempt, mentioned the names of my alchymists as the
              principal authors I had studied. The professor
              stared: "Have you," he said, "really spent your time
              in studying such nonsense?"</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I replied in the affirmative. "Every minute,"
              continued M. Krempe with warmth, "every instant that
              you have wasted on those books is utterly and
              entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with
              exploded systems and useless names. Good God! in what
              desert land have you lived, where no one was kind
              enough to inform you that these fancies, which you
              have so greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old,
              and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected
              in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a
              disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear
              sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>So saying, he stepped aside, and wrote down a list
              of several books treating of natural philosophy,
              which he desired me to procure; and dismissed me,
              after mentioning that in the beginning of the
              following week he intended to commence a course of
              lectures upon natural philosophy in its general
              relations, and that M.
              Waldman, a fellow-professor, would lecture upon
              chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I returned home, not disappointed, for I have said
              that I had long considered those authors useless whom
              the professor reprobated; but I returned, not at all
              the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
              shape. M. Krempe was a little squat
              man, with a gruff voice and a repulsive
              countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not
              prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a
              too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I
              have given an account of the conclusions I had come
              to concerning them in my early years. As a child, I
              had not been content with the results promised by the
              modern professors of natural science. With a
              confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
              extreme youth, and my
              want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the
              steps of knowledge along the paths of time, and
              exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the
              dreams of forgotten alchymists. Besides, I had a
              contempt
              for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was
              very different, when the masters of the science
              sought immortality and power; such views, although
              futile, were grand: but now the scene was changed.
              The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
              itself to the annihilation of those visions on
              which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I
              was required to exchange chimeras
              of boundless grandeur for realities of little
              worth.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Such were my reflections during the first two or
              three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were
              chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the
              localities, and the principal residents in my new
              abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought
              of the information which M. Krempe had given me
              concerning the lectures. And although I could not
              consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow
              deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what
              he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as
              he had hitherto been out of town.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Partly
              from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went
              into the lecturing room, which M.
              Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was
              very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty
              years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the
              greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his
              temples, but those at the back of his head were
              nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably
              erect; and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
              He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the
              history of chemistry, and the various improvements
              made by different men of learning, pronouncing with
              fervour the names of the most distinguished
              discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the
              present state of the science, and explained many of
              its elementary terms. After having made a few
              preparatory experiments, he concluded with a
              panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I
              shall never forget:—</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"The ancient teachers of this science," said he,
              "promised impossibilities, and performed nothing. The
              modern masters promise very little; they know that
              metals
              cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir of life
              is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose
              hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their
              eyes to pore over the microscope
              or crucible,
              have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into
              the recesses of nature, and show how she works in her
              hiding places. They ascend
              into the heavens: they have discovered how the
              blood
              circulates, and the nature
              of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and
              almost unlimited powers; they can command the
              thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even
              mock the invisible world with its own shadows."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Such were the professor's words—rather let
              me say such the
              words of fate, enounced to destroy me. As he went
              on, I felt as if my soul were grappling with a
              palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were
              touched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord
              after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled
              with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So
              much has been done, exclaimed the soul of
              Frankenstein,—more, far more, will I achieve:
              treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer
              a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the
              world the deepest mysteries of creation.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being
              was in a
              state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that
              order would thence arise, but I had no power to
              produce it. By degrees, after the morning's dawn,
              sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts
              were as a dream. There only remained a resolution to
              return to my ancient studies, and to devote myself to
              a science for which I believed myself to possess a
              natural talent. On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a
              visit. His manners in private were even more mild and
              attractive than in public; for there was a certain
              dignity in his mien during his lecture, which in his
              own house was replaced by the greatest affability and
              kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account
              of my former pursuits as I had given to his
              fellow-professor. He heard with attention the little
              narration concerning my studies, and smiled at the
              names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but
              without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He
              said, that "these were men to whose indefatigable
              zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of
              the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to
              us, as an easier task, to give new names, arrange
              in connected classifications, the facts which
              they in a great degree had been the instruments of
              bringing to light. The labours of men of genius,
              however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in
              ultimately turning to the solid advantage of
              mankind." I listened to his statement, which was
              delivered without any presumption or affectation; and
              then added, that his lecture had removed my
              prejudices against modern chemists; I
              expressed myself in measured terms, with the
              modesty and deference due from a youth to his
              instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in
              life would have made me ashamed) any of the
              enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I
              requested his advice concerning the books I ought to
              procure.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I am happy," said M. Waldman, "to have gained a
              disciple; and if your application equals your
              ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry
              is that branch of natural philosophy in which the
              greatest improvements have been and may be made; it
              is on that account that I have made it my peculiar
              study; but at the same time I have not neglected the
              other branches of science. A man would make but a
              very sorry chemist if he attended to that department
              of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become
              really a man of science, and not merely a petty
              experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to
              every branch of natural philosophy, including
              
              mathematics."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>He then took me into his laboratory, and explained
              to me the uses of his various machines; instructing
              me as to what I ought to procure, and promising me
              the use of his own when I should have advanced far
              enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.
              He also gave me the list of books which I had
              requested; and I took my leave.</p>
