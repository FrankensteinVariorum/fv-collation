            <item>
               <p> THE being
              finished speaking, and fixed his looks upon me in
              expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered,
              perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas
              sufficiently to understand the full extent of his
              proposition. He continued—</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"You must create a
              female for me, with whom I can live in the
              interchange of those sympathies
              necessary for my being. This you alone can do;
              and I demand it of you as a
              right which you must not refuse."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>The latter part of his
              tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died
              away while he narrated his peaceful life among the
              cottagers, and, as he said this, I could
              no longer suppress the rage that burned within
              me.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I do refuse it," I
              replied; "and no torture shall ever extort a consent
              from me. You may render me the most miserable of men,
              but you shall never make me base in my own eyes.
              Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint
              wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have
              answered you; you may torture me, but I will never
              consent."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> "You
              are in the wrong," replied the fiend;
              "and, instead of threatening, I am content to reason
              with you. I am malicious because I am miserable; am I
              not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my
              creator, would tear me to pieces, and triumph;
              remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more
              than he pities me? You would not call it murder, if
              you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts,
              and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.
              Shall I respect man, when he contemns me? Let him
              live with me in the interchange
              of kindness, and, instead of injury, I would
              bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude
              at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human
              senses are insurmountable barriers to our union.
              Yet mine shall not be the
              submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my
              injuries: if I cannot inspire love, I
              will cause fear; and chiefly towards you my
              arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear
              inextinguishable hatred. Have a care: I will work at
              your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your
              heart, so that you curse the hour of your birth."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>A fiendish rage
              animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled
              into contortions too horrible for human eyes to
              behold; but presently he calmed himself, and
              proceeded—</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I intended to reason.
              This passion is detrimental to me; for you do not
              reflect that you are the cause of its excess. If any
              being felt emotions of benevolence
              towards me, I should return them an hundred and an
              hundred fold; for that one creature's sake, I would
              make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in
              dreams of bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask
              of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a
              creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself:
              the gratification is small, but it is all that I can
              receive, and it shall content me. It is true,
              
              we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world;
              but on that account we shall be more attached to one
              another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will
              be harmless, and free from the misery I now feel. Oh!
              my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude
              towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite
              the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me
              my request!"</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> I was moved. I shuddered when I thought
              of the possible consequences of my consent; but I
              felt that there was some justice
              in his argument. His tale, and the feelings he now
              expressed, proved him to be a
              creature of fine sensations; and did I not, as
              his maker, owe him all the portion of happiness that
              it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of
              feeling, and continued—</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"If you consent,
              neither you nor any other human being shall ever see
              us again: I
              will go to the vast wilds of South America. My
              food is not that of man; I do
              not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut my
              appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient
              nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature
              as myself, and will be content with the same fare. We
              shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will
              shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food. The
              picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and
              you must feel that you could deny it only in the
              wantonness
              of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been
              towards me, I now see compassion
              in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment, and
              persuade you to promise what I so
              ardently desire."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"You propose," replied
              I, "to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in
              those wilds where the beasts of the field will be
              your only companions. How can you, who long for the
              love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?
              You will return, and again seek their kindness, and
              you will meet with their detestation; your
              evil passions will be renewed, and you will then
              have a companion to aid you in the task of
              destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the
              point, for I cannot consent."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> "How inconstant are your feelings! but a
              moment ago you were moved by my representations, and
              why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I
              swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by
              you that made me, that, with the companion you
              bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man, and
              dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of
              places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall
              meet
              with sympathy; my life will flow quietly away,
              and, in my dying moments, I shall not curse my
              maker."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>His words had a strange
              effect upon me. I compassionated him, and sometimes
              felt a wish to console him; but when I looked upon
              him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and
              talked, my heart sickened, and my feelings were
              altered to those of horror and hatred. I
              tried to stifle these sensations; I thought,
              that, as I could not sympathize with him, I had no
              right to withhold from him the small portion of
              happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"You swear," I said,
              "to be harmless; but have you not already shewn a
              degree of malice that should reasonably make me
              distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will
              increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for
              your revenge?"</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"How is this? I thought
              I had moved your compassion, and yet you still refuse
              to bestow on me the only benefit that can soften my
              heart, and render me harmless. If I have no ties and
              no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;
              the love of another will destroy the cause of my
              crimes, and I shall become a thing, of whose
              existence every one will be ignorant. My vices are
              the children of a forced
              solitude that I abhor; and my virtues will
              necessarily arise when I live in communion with an
              equal. I shall feel the
              affections of a sensitive being, and become
              linked to the chain
              of existence and events, from which I am now
              excluded."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> I paused some time to
              reflect on all he had related, and the various
              arguments which he had employed. I thought of the
              promise of virtues which he had displayed on the
              opening of his existence, and the subsequent blight
              of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which
              his protectors had manifested towards him. His power
              and threats were not omitted in my calculations: a
              creature who could exist in the ice caves of the
              glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit among the
              ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being
              possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with.
              After a long pause of reflection, I concluded, that
              the justice
              due both to him and my fellow-creatures demanded of
              me that I should comply with his request. Turning to
              him, therefore, I said—</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I consent to your
              demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,
              and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as
              soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who
              will accompany you in your exile."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>"I swear," he cried,
              "by
              the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, that if
              you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never
              behold me again. Depart to your home, and commence
              your labours: I shall watch their progress with
              unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you
              are ready I shall appear."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Saying this, he
              suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change
              in my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with
              greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and
              quickly
              lost him among the undulations of the sea of
              ice.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> His tale had occupied the whole day; and
              the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he
              departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent
              towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed
              in darkness; but my
              heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of
              winding among the little paths of the mountains, and
              fixing my feet firmly as I advanced, perplexed me,
              occupied as I was by the emotions which the
              occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far
              advanced, when I came to the half-way resting-place,
              and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars
              shone at intervals, as the clouds passed from over
              them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here
              and there a broken tree lay on the ground: it was
              a
              scene of wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange
              thoughts within me. I wept bitterly; and, clasping my
              hands in agony, I exclaimed, "Oh!
              stars, and clouds, and winds, ye are all about to
              mock me: if ye really pity me, crush sensation and
              memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart,
              depart and leave me in darkness."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>These were wild and
              miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how
              the eternal
              twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and how I
              listened to every blast of wind, as if it were a dull
              ugly siroc
              on its way to consume me.</p>

            <item>
               <p>Morning dawned before I
              arrived at the village of Chamounix; but my presence,
              so haggard and strange, hardly calmed the fears of my
              family, who had waited the whole night in anxious
              expectation of my return.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> The following day we returned to Geneva.
              The intention of my father in coming had been to
              divert my mind, and to restore me to my lost
              tranquillity; but the medicine had been fatal. And,
              unable to account for the excess
              of misery I appeared to suffer, he hastened to
              return home, hoping the quiet and monotony of a
              domestic life would by degrees alleviate my
              sufferings from whatsoever cause they might
              spring.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>For myself, I was
              passive in all their arrangements; and the gentle
              affection of my beloved Elizabeth was inadequate to
              draw me from the depth of my despair. The promise I
              had made to the dæmon weighed upon my mind,
              like Dante's
              iron cowl on the heads of the hellish hypocrites.
              All
              pleasures of earth and sky passed before me like
              a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality
              of life. Can you wonder, that sometimes a
              kind of insanity possessed me, or that I saw
              continually about me a multitude of filthy animals
              inflicting on me incessant torture, that often
              extorted screams and bitter groans?</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>By degrees, however,
              these feelings became calmed. I entered again into
              the every-day scene of life, if not with interest, at
              least with some degree of tranquillity.</p>
